    "content": "While we’re already feeling\nthe devastating effects of human-caused climate change, governments continue to fall short\non making and executing emissions pledges that would help thwart further warming. So, what will our world look like\nin the next 30 to 80 years, if we continue on the current path? While it’s impossible to know exactly\nhow the next decade will unfold, scientists and climate experts have\nmade projections, factoring in the current state of affairs. This future we’re about to describe\nis bleak, but remember there’s still time to ensure\nit doesn’t become our reality. It’s 2050. We’ve blown past the 1.5 degree target\nthat world leaders promised to stick to. The Earth has warmed 2 degrees\nsince the 1800s, when the world first started burning\nfossil fuels in mass scale. Reports on heatwaves and wildfires\nregularly fill the evening news. Summer days exceed 40 degrees in London\nand 45 degrees in Delhi, as extreme heat waves are now\n8 to 9 times more common. These high temperatures prompt\nwidespread blackouts, as power grids struggle to keep\nup with the energy demands needed to properly cool homes. Ambulance sirens blare through the night, carrying patients suffering from\nheatstroke, dehydration, and exhaustion. The southwestern United States,\nsouthern Africa, and eastern Australia experience longer, more frequent,\nand more severe droughts. Meanwhile, the Philippines, Indonesia,\nand Japan face more frequent heavy rainfall as rising temperatures cause water\nto evaporate faster, and trap more water in the atmosphere. As the weather becomes more erratic, some communities are unable\nto keep pace with rebuilding what’s constantly destroyed. Many move to cities, where they face housing shortages\nand a lack of jobs. A resource squeeze is felt\nin newborn intensive care wards, as the rising temperature\nand air pollution cause higher rates of premature\nand underweight births. More children develop asthma\nand respiratory disease, and rates balloon in communities regularly\nexposed to forest fire smoke. The global emissions added\nto the atmosphere each year finally start to level off,\nthanks to government action, but it’s decades too late. We fail to reach net zero in time. As a result, by 2100 the Earth has\nwarmed another 0.5 to 1.5 degrees. Over half of our remaining\nglaciers have melted. As the sea heats up, its volume increases\ndue to thermal expansion. Together, this elevates sea level\nby well over a meter. Entire nations, like the Marshall Islands\nand Tuvalu, are uninhabitable as large swaths of their islands\nare submerged. Some islands, like the Maldives, spend billions building\ninterconnected rafts that house apartments,\nschools, and restaurants that float above its drowned cities. Resettled climate migrants\nin Jakarta, Mumbai, and Lagos are forced to abandon\ntheir homes once again, as rising tides and extreme storms flood\nbuildings and crumble infrastructure. Overall, 250 million people are displaced. Some affluent cities like New York\nand Shanghai attempt to adapt, elevating buildings and roadways. Ten-meter-tall seawalls line\nthe cities’ coasts. Children learn about extinct sea life\nwhich once inhabited the ocean’s reefs, all of which have vanished thanks\nto rising surface water temperatures. Grocery prices skyrocket, as food and water scarcity\ntouch all communities. Fruits and products long grown\nin the tropics and subtropics rarely show up on shelves, as intense heat waves paired\nwith increasing humidity make it deadly for farmers\nto work outdoors. Unpredictable heatwaves,\ndroughts, and floods cripple small-scale farmers\nin Africa, Asia, and South America, who previously produced one-third\nof the world’s food. Hundreds of millions of people are\npushed into hunger and famine. Climate predictions can feel\noverwhelming and terrifying. Yet many of the experts responsible\nfor these assessments remain optimistic. Since countries have first begun\ntaking steps to lower their emissions, warming projections have\nshifted downwards. In less than a decade,\nwe’ve reduced our projected emission rates so that we’re no longer on track\nto hit nearly 4 degrees of warming. Policies that invest\nin renewable energy sources, cut fossil fuel production,\nsupport electric transportation, protect our forests,\nand regulate industry can help mitigate the worst effects\nof climate change. But climate experts have also stressed\nthat current policies and pledges don’t go far enough—\nin speed or scale. Enacting real change will\nrequire bold solutions, innovations, and collective action. There’s still time to rewrite our future,\nand every tenth of a degree counts."

    "content": "Rising temperatures and seas, massive droughts, changing landscapes. Successfully adapting to climate change\nis growing increasingly important. For humans, this means using\nour technological advancement to find solutions, like smarter cities\nand better water management. But for some plants and animals, adapting to these global changes\ninvolves the most ancient solution of all: evolution. Evolutionary adaptation usually occurs\nalong time scales of thousands to hundreds of thousands of years. But in cases where species are under\nespecially strong selective conditions, like those caused \nby rapidly changing climates, adaptive evolution \ncan happen more quickly. In recent decades, we've seen many plants, animals, and insects relocating themselves and undergoing changes\nto their body sizes, and the dates they flower or breed. But many of these are plastic, or nonheritable changes\nto an individual's physical traits. And there are limits to how much\nan organism can change its own physiology to meet environmental requirements. That's why scientists are seeking\nexamples of evolutionary changes coded in species' DNA that are heritable, long-lasting, and may provide a key to their future. Take the tawny owl. If you were walking through a wintry\nforest in northern Europe 30 years ago, chances are you'd have heard,\nrather than seen, this elusive bird. Against the snowy backdrop, its plumage would have been\nnear impossible to spot. Today, the landscape is vastly different. Since the 1980s, climate change has led to significantly\nless snowfall, but you'd still struggle \nto spot a tawny owl because nowadays, they're brown. The brown color variant is the genetically\ndominant form of plumage in this species, but historically, the recessive pale gray variant triumphed because of its selective advantage\nin helping these predators blend in. However, less snow cover reduces\nopportunities for camouflage, so lately, this gray color variant has been losing \nthe battle against natural selection. The offspring of the brown color morphs,\non the other hand, have an advantage in exposed forests, so brown tawny owls are flourishing today. Several other species have undergone similar climate-change-adaptive \ngenetic changes in recent decades. Pitcher plant mosquitoes \nhave rapidly evolved to take advantage \nof the warmer temperatures, entering dormancy later \nand later in the year. Two spot ladybug populations, once comprised of equal numbers\nof melanic and non-melanic morphs, have now shifted almost entirely\nto the non-melanic color combination. Scientists think that keeps them\nfrom overheating. Meanwhile, pink salmon have adapted\nto warmer waters by spawning earlier in the season\nto protect their sensitive eggs. And wild thyme plants in Europe\nare producing more repellent oils to protect themselves \nagainst the herbivores that become more common when it's warm. These plants and animals belong to a group\nof about 20 identified species with evolutionary adaptations\nto rapid climate change, including snapping turtles, wood frogs, knotweed, and silver spotted skipper butterflies. However, scientists hope to discover\nmore species evolving in response to climate change\nout of 8.7 million species on the planet. For most of our planet's astounding\nand precious biodiversity, evolution won't be the answer. Instead, many of those species\nwill have to rely on us to help them survive a changing world or face extinction. The good news is\nwe already have the tools. Across the planet, we're making\non-the-ground decisions that will help entire ecosystems adapt. Critical climate refuges \nare being identified and set aside, and projects are underway to help\nmobile species move to more suitable climates. Existing parks and protected areas\nare also doing climate change check-ups to help their wildlife cope. Fortunately, it's still within our power to preserve much of \nthe wondrous biodiversity of this planet, which, after all, sustains us\nin so many ways."

    "content": "For 3 billion people around the world, seafood provides a significant source \nof protein and nutrition. But recent studies show that 33% of wild \nfisheries are overfished, while another 60% are fished at their \nmaximum capacity. In fact, over half the seafood we eat– from finfish and shellfish to \nseaweed and algae– isn’t caught in the wild. It’s grown through aquaculture, \nor aquatic farming. Farmed seafood is one of the \nfastest-growing food industries, expanding in volume by 5.8% each year. But different methods of aquaculture come \nwith different advantages and issues– some of which echo the serious problems \nwe’ve seen in industrial agriculture. So how can we avoid repeating the mistakes\nwe’ve made on land, at sea? What aquaculture approaches are we \ncurrently using, and what does a sustainable way \nto farm the ocean really look like? One of the most common aquaculture \nmethods involves large pens made of nets, where fish are farmed offshore in floating\ncages roughly 1000 square meters in size. Commonly employed off the coast of Chile\nand in the fjords of Norway, these fish, like many industrially \nfarmed animals, occupy stressful, overcrowded pens. They produce massive amounts of waste, polluting the surrounding areas and potentially spreading diseases\nto wild species. Worse still, since the antibiotics \nemployed to fight disease aren’t fully absorbed by the fish, they get excreted back \ninto the environment. Net pens are also susceptible to escapes, unleashing huge numbers of fish which \ncompete for resources and weaken the local gene pool \nwith genes adapted for captivity. Escaped fish can even disrupt local \necosystems as invasive species. Other techniques, such as man-made coastal ponds commonly\nused for shrimp farming in Southeast Asia, create additional environmental problems. Just like net pens, these ponds are prone\nto spreading pollution and disease. Their construction also frequently \ndestroys important ecosystems like mangroves and marshes, which protect coastal areas from storms, provide habitats, and absorb tons \nof greenhouse gases. One way to solve these problems is to farm\nfish on land in completely contained systems. Tanks and raceways can recirculate and \nfilter water to prevent pollution. But even fully contained facilities still \ncontend with another major hurdle: fishmeal. About 10% of the seafood caught globally\nis used to feed animals, including carnivorous farmed fish. Researchers are working on fish feed made \nof insects and plant-based proteins, but for now many inland fish farms \nare connected to overfishing. All these obstacles can make sustainable \naquaculture feel a long way off, but innovative farmers are finding new \nways to responsibly farm the seas. The most promising solution of all \nmay be to look lower on the food chain. Instead of cramming large, carnivorous \nfish into pens, we can work with natural ocean systems to produce huge amounts of shellfish \nand seaweeds. These low-maintenance flora and fauna \ndon’t need to be fed at all. In fact, they naturally improve \nwater quality, filtering it as they feed off of sunlight \nand nutrients in the seawater. By absorbing carbon through \nphotosynthesis, these farms help battle climate change, and reduce local ocean acidification while creating habitats for other \nspecies to thrive. Shifting to restorative ocean farming could provide good jobs for \ncoastal communities, and support healthy plant and \nshellfish-based diets that have an incredibly \nlow carbon footprint. In just 5 months, 4,000 square meters of ocean can \nproduce 25 tons of seaweed and 250,000 of shellfish. With the right distribution network, a series of small farms, collectively \nthe size of Washington State could feed the planet. Farms like these are already popping up\naround the globe, and a new generation of farmers is \nstepping up to pursue a more sustainable future. Done properly, regenerative ocean farming could play\na vital role in helping our oceans, our climate, and ourselves."

    "content": "Standing at almost 84 meters tall, this is the largest known living tree\non the planet. Nicknamed General Sherman, this giant sequoia has sequestered\nroughly 1,400 tons of atmospheric carbon over its estimated 2,500 years on earth. Very few trees can compete \nwith this carbon impact, but today, humanity produces more \nthan 1,400 tons of carbon every minute. To combat climate change, we need to steeply reduce \nfossil fuel emissions, and draw down excess CO2 \nto restore our atmosphere’s balance of greenhouse gases. But what can trees do to help\nin this fight? And how do they sequester carbon \nin the first place? Like all plants, trees consume\natmospheric carbon through a chemical reaction \ncalled photosynthesis. This process uses energy \nfrom sunlight to convert water and carbon dioxide \ninto oxygen and energy-storing carbohydrates. Plants then consume \nthese carbohydrates in a reverse process called respiration, \nconverting them to energy and releasing carbon \nback into the atmosphere. In trees, however, a large portion\nof that carbon isn’t released, and instead, is stored \nas newly formed wood tissue. During their lifetimes, \ntrees act as carbon vaults, and they continue to draw down carbon \nfor as long as they grow. However, when a tree dies\nand decays, some of its carbon will be released\nback into the air. A significant amount of CO2\nis stored in the soil, where it can remain \nfor thousands of years. But eventually, that carbon\nalso seeps back into the atmosphere. So if trees are going to help \nfight a long-term problem like climate change, they need to survive to sequester \ntheir carbon for the longest period possible, \nwhile also reproducing quickly. Is there one type of tree \nwe could plant that meets these criteria? Some fast growing, long-lived, \nsuper sequestering species we could scatter worldwide? Not that we know of. But even if such a tree existed, it wouldn’t be a good \nlong-term solution. Forests are complex networks \nof living organisms, and there’s no one species \nthat can thrive in every ecosystem. The most sustainable trees to plant \nare always native ones; species that already play a role \nin their local environment. Preliminary research shows \nthat ecosystems with a naturally occurring diversity\nof trees have less competition for resources and better resist\nclimate change. This means we can’t just plant trees \nto draw down carbon; we need to restore depleted ecosystems. There are numerous regions\nthat have been clear cut or developed that are ripe for restoring. In 2019, a study led \nby Zurich’s Crowtherlab analyzed satellite imagery \nof the world’s existing tree cover. By combining it with climate and soil data and excluding areas necessary\nfor human use, they determined Earth could support nearly one billion hectares \nof additional forest. That’s roughly 1.2 trillion trees. This staggering number surprised\nthe scientific community, prompting additional research. Scientists now cite a more conservative \nbut still remarkable figure. By their revised estimates,\nthese restored ecosystems could capture anywhere from 100 to 200\nbillion tons of carbon, accounting for over one-sixth\nof humanity’s carbon emissions. More than half of the potential\nforest canopy for new restoration efforts \ncan be found in just six countries. And the study can also provide insight\ninto existing restoration projects, like The Bonn Challenge, which aims to restore 350 million hectares\nof forest by 2030. But this is where it gets complicated. Ecosystems are incredibly complex, and it’s unclear whether they’re best \nrestored by human intervention. It’s possible the right thing \nto do for certain areas is to simply leave them alone. Additionally, some researchers\nworry that restoring forests on this scale may have unintended \nconsequences, like producing natural bio-chemicals at a pace that could actually \naccelerate climate change. And even if we succeed \nin restoring these areas, future generations would need\nto protect them from the natural and economic forces\nthat previously depleted them. Taken together, these challenges\nhave damaged confidence in restoration projects worldwide. And the complexity \nof rebuilding ecosystems demonstrates how important \nit is to protect our existing forests. But hopefully, restoring \nsome of these depleted regions will give us the data and conviction \nnecessary to combat climate change on a larger scale. If we get it right, maybe these modern\ntrees will have time to grow into carbon carrying titans."

    "content": "In summer 1997, a full-page ad appeared\nin The New York Times. The message, from the\nGlobal Climate Coalition, issued a dire economic warning about the\nUS embracing the Kyoto Protocol, a treaty to curb greenhouse gas emissions. But beneath the veneer of smiling children\nwas something much more insidious: a multi-million dollar campaign\npropped up by questionable data and backed by some of the world's\nmost powerful companies. The Global Climate Coalition was itself\na front for the oil industry— established to sow doubt and confusion\nabout climate action. But the real story starts decades earlier. In the 1970s, oil companies employed some\nof the world's top atmospheric scientists, as they needed to understand\nweather-related risks to their equipment and to assess the environmental\nimpact of new projects. By the late 1970s, these scientists,\nalong with their counterparts in academia, had concluded that burning fossil fuels\ncreated a build up of atmospheric carbon, which would impact the climate\nby trapping heat and increasing surface temperatures. They warned that an increase of even\na few degrees could be catastrophic and accurately predicted events\nsuch as rapid Arctic warming and the melting of Antarctic ice sheets. Throughout the 1980s, oil industry reps\nmet repeatedly to discuss these dangers, acknowledging the risk that their product\nposed to the future of humanity. However, instead of warning the public, or using this knowledge to pivot\ntowards renewable energy sources, they doubled down on oil. But in the late 1980s, scientists sounded\nthe alarm about climate change, raising public awareness, and\nleading to calls for government action. In response, the oil industry launched\nwhat would become a decades-long, multi-billion-dollar PR campaign to discredit the very science\nthey helped pioneer. They utilized the same PR firms that had\npreviously helped the tobacco industry  mislead the public\nabout the harms of smoking. Oil companies directly lobbied\ngovernment officials and covertly funded dozens\nof organizations like the Global Climate Coalition, whose objective was to obscure the\nscientific consensus on climate change and humanity's role in creating it. They attacked credible scientists  and bankrolled advertisements\ndisguised as op-eds, which falsely exaggerated the degree\nand significance of uncertainty in climate models and used that uncertainty as an excuse\nto dismiss the science entirely. These \"advertorials\" grabbed\nreader's attention with titles like \"Lies They Tell Our Children,\"\nand \"Unsettled Science.\" The industry also capitalized\non lingering Cold War anxieties that equated government regulation\nwith socialism.  Thus, at the very moment\nthe world was poised to act, oil companies shifted the conversation\naway from the actual science and turned it into a debate\nabout protecting freedom. By doing so, they took a non-partisan,\nuncontentious topic and transformed it into a\nhot-button political issue. After George W. Bush became\npresident in 2001, oil lobbyists successfully pushed his\nadministration to replace officials who agreed with mainstream science  with ones who opposed\nenvironmental regulations. When Bush pushed the US\nout of the Kyoto Protocol, his administration credited\nthe Global Climate Coalition with influencing his decision. But the oil industry's PR campaigns\ndidn't end with their Kyoto victory. They've continued to shape\nthe climate conversation, pushing propaganda and co-opting\nclimate language. British Petroleum, for example,\npopularized the phrase \"carbon footprint,\" an idea which in practice effectively\nshifts climate responsibility from the industry to the consumer. To this day, the industry massively\noveremphasizes their investment  in green energies,\nsuch as biofuels,  which represent just 1% of their budgets. And they employ legions of lobbyists,\nwho attend UN climate meetings and work to water down the language\nof IPCC climate assessment reports. In this, they're allied with\noil-producing countries, which also have a vested interest\nin continued fossil fuel use. While the oil companies now acknowledge\nthat burning fossil fuels  contributes to climate change, they deny having misled the public, arguing that their messaging always\nreflected the scientific consensus. But an extensive paper trail\nshows otherwise. While oil companies' profits\nreach all-time highs, climate change costs the public\nbillions of dollars each year. Extreme weather events and decreasing air\nquality kill millions of people annually. Meanwhile, the culture of doubt the\noil industry created remains widespread, polarizing the issue,\nand delaying meaningful action. But it doesn't have to be this way. We can still reclaim the conversation\nand change course, embracing renewable energies\nand sustainable practices to protect both our planet and our future."

    "content": "Cloudy climate change:\nHow clouds affect Earth's temperature. Earth's average surface temperature\nhas warmed by .8 Celsius since 1750. When carbon dioxide concentrations\nin the atmosphere have doubled, which is expected before the end\nof the 21st century, researchers project global temperatures will have risen by \n1.5 to 4.5 degrees Celsius. If the increase is near the low end,\n1.5 Celsius, then we're already halfway there,\nand we should be more able to adapt with some regions becoming drier\nand less productive, but others becoming warmer,\nwetter and more productive. On the other hand, a rise of 4.5 degrees\nCelsius would be similar in magnitude to the warming that's occurred since\nthe last glacial maximum 22,000 years ago, when most of North America was under\nan ice sheet two kilometers thick. So that would represent a \ndramatic change of climate. So it's vitally important for scientists\nto predict the change in temperature with as much precision as possible\nso that society can plan for the future. The present range of uncertainty\nis simply too large to be confident of how best\nto respond to climate change. But this estimate of 1.5 to 4.5 Celsius\nfor a doubling of carbon dioxide hasn't changed in 35 years. Why haven't we been able \nto narrow it down? The answer is that we don't yet understand\naerosols and clouds well enough. But a new experiment at CERN\nis tackling the problem. In order to predict how\nthe temperature will change, scientists need to know something\ncalled Earth's climate sensitivity, the temperature change in response\nto a radiative forcing. A radiative forcing is \na temporary imbalance between the energy received from the Sun\nand the energy radiated back out to space, like the imbalance caused by an\nincrease of greenhouse gases. To correct the imbalance,\nEarth warms up or cools down. We can determine Earth's\nclimate sensitivity from the experiment that we've already performed in the industrial age \nsince 1750 and then use this number to determine\nhow much more it will warm for various projected radiative forcings\nin the 21st century. To do this, we need to know\ntwo things: First, the global temperature rise\nsince 1750, and second, the radiative forcing\nof the present day climate relative to the pre-industrial climate. For the radiative forcings,\nwe know that human activities have increased greenhouse gases\nin the atmosphere, which have warmed the planet. But our activities have at the same time\nincreased the amount of aerosol particles in clouds,\nwhich have cooled the planet. Pre-industrial greenhouse gas\nconcentrations are well measured from bubbles trapped in ice cores\nobtained in Greenland and Antarctica. So the greenhouse gas forcings\nare precisely known. But we have no way of directly measuring\nhow cloudy it was in 1750. And that's the main source of uncertainty\nin Earth's climate sensitivity. To understand pre-industrial cloudiness, we must use computer models\nthat reliably simulate the processes responsible for \nforming aerosols in clouds. Now to most people, aerosols are the thing\nthat make your hair stick, but that's only one type of aerosol. Atmospheric aerosols are tiny liquid\nor solid particles suspended in the air. They are either primary, from dust, sea spray salt\nor burning biomass, or secondary, formed by gas to\nparticle conversion in the atmosphere, also known as particle nucleation. Aerosols are everywhere in the atmosphere, and they can block out the sun\nin polluted urban environments, or bathe distant mountains in a blue haze. More importantly, a cloud droplet cannot\nform without an aerosol particle seed. So without aerosol particles,\nthere'd be no clouds, and without clouds,\nthere'd be no fresh water. The climate would be much hotter,\nand there would be no life. So we owe our existence\nto aerosol particles. However, despite their importance, how aerosol particles form\nin the atmosphere and their effect on clouds \nare poorly understood. Even the vapors responsible\nfor aerosol particle formation are not well established because they're present in only\nminute amounts, near one molecule per million million\nmolecules of air. This lack of understanding\nis the main reason for the large uncertainty \nin climate sensitivity, and the corresponding wide range\nof future climate projections. However, an experiment underway at CERN,\nnamed, perhaps unsurprisingly, \"Cloud\" has managed to build a steel vessel\nthat's large enough and has a low enough contamination,\nthat aerosol formation can, for the first time, be measured under\ntightly controlled atmospheric conditions in the laboratory. In its first five years of operation,\nCloud has identified the vapors responsible for aerosol particle\nformation in the atmosphere, which include sulfuric acid,\nammonia, amines, and biogenic vapors from trees. Using an ionizing particle beam\nfrom the CERN proton synchrotron, Cloud is also investigating\nif galactic cosmic rays enhance the formation of \naerosols in clouds. This has been suggested as a possible\nunaccounted natural climate forcing agent since the flux of cosmic rays raining\ndown on the atmosphere varies with solar activity. So Cloud is addressing two big questions: Firstly, how cloudy was the \npre-industrial climate? And, hence, how much have\nclouds changed due to human activities? That knowledge will help sharpen\nclimate projections in the 21st century. And secondly, could the puzzling\nobservations of solar climate variability in the pre-industrial climate be explained\nby an influence of galactic cosmic rays on clouds? Ambitious but realistic goals\nwhen your head's in the clouds."

    "content": "[Music] [Music] this is the skyline of my hometown New Orleans it was a great place to grow up but it's one of the most vulnerable spots in the world half the city is already below sea level in 2005 the world watched as New Orleans and the Gulf Coast were devastated by Hurricane Katrina 1,836 people died nearly 300,000 homes were lost these are my mothers at the top although that's not her car it was carried there by floodwaters up to the roof and that's my sister's below fortunately they and other family members got out in time but they lost their homes and as you can see just about everything in them other parts of the world have been hit by storms in even more devastating ways in 2008 cyclone narus and its aftermath killed 138,000 in Myanmar climate change is affecting our homes our communities our way of life we should be preparing at every scale and at every opportunity this talk is about being prepared for and resilient to the changes that are coming and that will affect our homes and our Collective home the Earth the changes in these times won't affect us all equally they're important distributional consequences and they're not what you always might think in New Orleans the elderly and female-headed households were among the most vulnerable for those invulnerable low-lying Nations how do you put a dollar value on losing your country where your ancestors are buried and where will your people go and how will they COPE in a foreign land will there be tensions over immigration or conflicts over competition for limited resources it's already fueled conflicts in Chad and R4 like it or not ready or not this is our future sure some are looking for opportunities in this new world that's the Russians planting a flag on the ocean bottom to stake a claim for minerals under the receding Arctic sea ice but while there might be some short-term individual winners our Collective losses will far outweigh them look no further than the insurance industry as struggle to cope with mounting catastrophic losses from extreme weather events the military gets it they call climate change a threat multiplier that could harm stability and security while governments around the world are evaluating how to respond so what can we do how can we prepare and adapt I'd like to share three sets of examples starting with adapting to Violent storms and floods in New Orleans the I 10 twin spans with sections knocked out in Katrina have been rebuilt 21 ft higher to allow for greater storm surge and these raised and energy efficient homes were developed by Brad Pit and make it right for the hard- hit Ninth Ward the devastated Church by Mom and tens has been not only rebuilt higher it's poised to become the first Energy Star Church in the country they're selling electricity back to the grid thanks to solar panels reflective paint and more their March electricity bill was only $48 now these are examples of New Orleans rebuilding in this way but better if others act proactively with these changes in mind for example in galvaston here's a resilient home that Survived Hurricane Ike when others on neighboring Lots clearly did not and around the world satellites and Warning Systems are saving lives in flood prone areas such as Bangladesh but as important as technology and infrastructure are perhaps the human element is even more critical we need better planning and systems for evacuation we need to better understand how people make decisions in times of Crisis and why while it's true that many who died in Katrina did not have access to Transportation others who did refus to leave as the storm approached often because available transportation and shelters refus to allow them to take their pets imagine leaving behind your own pet in an evacuation or rescue fortunately in 2006 Congress passed the pet evacuation and transportation standards act it spells pets to change that second preparing for heat and drought farmers are facing challenges of drought from Asia to Africa from Australia to Oklahoma while heat waves linked with climate change have killed tens of thousands of people in Western Europe in 2003 and again in Russia in 2010 in Ethiopia 70% that's 70% of the population depends on rainfall for its livelihood Oxfam and swiss ray together with Rockefeller Foundation are helping Farmers like this one build Hillside Terraces and find other ways to conserve water but they're also providing for insurance when the droughts do come the stability this provides is giving the farmers the confidence to invest it's giving them access to Affordable Credit it's allowing them to become more productive so that they can afford their own insurance over time without assistance it's a virtuous cycle and one that could be replicated throughout the developing world after a lethal 1995 Heatwave turned refrigerator trucks from the popular Taste of Chicago Festival into makeshift morgs Chicago became a recognized leader tamping down on the urban heat island impact through opening cooling centers Outreach to vulnerable neighborhoods planting trees creating cool White vegetated green roofs this is City Hall's green roof next to cook County's roof which is 77° f hotter at the surface Washington DC last year actually led the nation in new green roofs installed and they're funding this in part thanks to a 5cent tax on plastic bags they're splitting the cost of installing these green roofs with home and building owners the roofs not only temper Urban heat island impact but they save energy and therefore money the emissions that cause climate change and they also reduce storm water runoff so some solutions to heat can provide for win win winds third adapting to Rising Seas sea level rise threatens Coastal ecosystems agriculture even major cities this is what 1 to 2 meters of sea level rise looks like in the Mong Delta that's where half of Vietnam's rice is gr infrastructure is going to be affected airports around the world are located on the coast it makes sense right there's open space the planes can take off and land without worrying about creating noise or avoiding tall buildings here's just one example San Francisco airport with 16 Ines or more of flooding Imagine The Staggering cost of protecting this vital infrastructure with Lees but there might be some changes in store that you might not imagine for example planes require more runway for takeoff because the heated less dense air provides for Less lift San Francisco is also spending $40 million to rethink and redesign its water and sewage treatment as water outfall pipes like this one can be flooded with seawater causing backups at the plant harming the bacteria that are needed to treat the waste so these alal pipes have been retrofitted to shut seawater off from entering the system Beyond these Technical Solutions our work at the Georgetown climate center with communities encourages them to look at what existing legal and policy tools are available and to consider how they can accommodate change for example in L use which areas do you want to protect through adding a seaw wall for example alter by raising buildings or Retreat from to allow the migration of important natural systems such as Wetlands or beaches other examples to consider in the UK the temps barrier protects London from storm surge the Asian City's climate resilience network is restoring vital ecosystems like Forest mangroves these are not only important ecosystems in their own right but they also serve as a buffer to protect Inland communities New York City is incredibly vulnerable to storms as you can see from this clever sign and to sea level rise and to storm surge as you can see from the subway flooding but back above ground these raised ventilation grates for the subway system show that Solutions can be both functional and attractive in fact in New York San Francisco and London designers have envisioned ways to better integrate the the natural and built environments with climate change in mind I think these are inspiring examples of what's possible when we feel empowered to plan for a world that will be different but now a word of caution adaptation is too important to be left to The Experts why well there are no experts we're entering Uncharted Territory and yet our expertise and our systems are based on the past stationarity is the notion that we can anticipate the future based on the past and plan accordingly and this principle governs much of our engineering our design of critical infrastructure City Water Systems building codes even water rights and other legal precedents but we can simply no longer rely on established Norms we're operating outside the bounds of CO2 concentrations that this planet has seen for hundreds of thousands of years the larger point I'm trying to make is this it's up to us to look at our homes in our communities our vulnerabilities and our exposures to risk and to find ways to not just survive but to thrive and it's up to us to plan and to prepare and to call in our government leaders and require them to do the same even while they address the underlying causes of climate change there are no quick fixes there are no one size fits-all Solutions we're all learning by doing but the operative word is doing thank you [Music]"

    "content": "Mohammadpur has always had \na unique relationship with the weather. Located at the mouth of the Bay of Bengal, this coastal village was built \non top of the Meghna River delta. Deltas are a kind of landmass formed \nwhen sediment carried by rivers is deposited where that river meets \na larger body of water. River deltas are incredibly fertile\necosystems capable of supporting abundant agriculture\nand marine life. However, their borders gradually change\nas rivers bring more sediment in and storms wash sediment away. The residents of Mohammadpur are well\naccustomed to managing the ebbs and flows of this ever-shifting\nlandscape. But lately, an abundance of intense\ncyclones have caused frequent flooding that impedes farming and fishing. These floods also erode the coastline, allowing later storms to wipe\naway land altogether. Since 2000, the Meghna River has overtaken\nthe coastline by 2.5 kilometers, forcing many villagers to move inland\nor to nearby cities. Mohammadpur isn’t the only place \nwhere erratic weather is impacting people’s mobility. Repeated typhoons in the Philippines have \ndisplaced thousands from their homes. In Fiji, the government is already moving\nmany coastal villages inland to get ahead of predicted land loss. And in the United States, melting permafrost is causing chunks\nof the Alaskan coastline to erode. In some ways, this is nothing new. Humanity has always adapted\nto changing weather and moved to regions that best support\ncultural lifestyles and livelihoods. However, scientists agree \nthat this rise in extreme weather is a by-product of Earth’s \nrapidly changing climate. Global warming increases the frequency and\nintensity of storms, flooding and drought, while also melting polar ice caps \nand raising sea levels. These factors are changing the environment\nmuch faster than they have in the past. Even for communities with the resources \nto take action, the variable pace and nature of these\nchanges makes them difficult to adapt to. And the vulnerable populations most\nimpacted by climate change are often those least responsible. Many facing climate mobility live \nin farming and fishing communities in countries that generate dramatically \nfewer emissions than their larger counterparts. Bangladesh is one such country. The nation has a unique combination\nof low-lying geography and heavily populated coastal regions. Most of these vulnerable coastal families,\nlike those in Mohammadpur, don’t want to abandon \ntheir homes and livelihoods. And for others, leaving Bangladesh\nisn’t financially practical. So to stay with their communities, many have moved a few meters inland and built more resilient homes\non higher ground or elevated stilts. Others have tried to buy land on newly\nemerging islands in the delta, while some have sent family members\nto find work in nearby cities. A handful of individuals might even cross\ninternational borders, if they have family, friends, or work \nconnections on the other side. But many of the residents who’ve left\nare eager to return home. Unfortunately, it's unclear when\nweather extremes will die down, and the government has repeatedly delayed\nprojects to build concrete embankments that would prevent further erosion. In other parts of the world, people couldn’t move inland \neven if they wanted to. The low-lying Pacific Island nations \nof Kiribati and Tuvalu are only 811 square kilometers\nand 26 square kilometers, respectively; so migration would mean moving \nto a different country altogether. Instead, their governments and citizens\nhave united in physically, legally, and politically \nfortifying their countries. Island residents are planting\ncoastal mangrove forests, and building up low-lying areas of land\nwith dredged sand to shield themselves against storms \nand rising sea levels. And the islands’ governments have\nrepeatedly lobbied on the global stage for countries with the highest emissions \nto reduce pollution and take responsibility \nfor climate change. The challenges facing\neach coastal community are unique, and the diversity of the people's\nexperiences can make climate mobility a difficult phenomenon \nto measure and define. But as new communities are endangered\nby extreme weather, it’s more important than ever\nto listen to those on the front lines of this crisis."

    "content": "Two frogs are minding their own business\nin the swamp when WHAM— they’re kidnapped. They come to in a kitchen, \ncaptives of a menacing chef. He boils up a pot of water \nand lobs one of the frogs in. But it’s having none of this. The second its toes hit the scalding water\nit jumps right out the window. The chef refills the pot, but this time \nhe doesn’t turn on the heat. He plops the second frog in,\nand this frog’s okay with that. The chef turns the heat on, very low, \nand the temperature of water slowly rises. So slowly that the frog doesn’t notice. In fact, it basks in the balmy water. Only when the surface begins to bubble\ndoes the frog realize: it’s toast. What’s funny about this parable is that\nit’s not scientifically true... for frogs. In reality, a frog will detect slowly\nheating water and leap to safety. Humans, on the other hand,\nare a different story. We’re perfectly happy to sit in the pot \nand slowly turn up the heat, all the while insisting it isn’t our hand\non the dial, arguing about whether we can \ntrust thermometers, and questioning— \neven if they’re right, does it matter? It does. Since 1850, global average temperatures \nhave risen by 1 degree Celsius. That may not sound like a lot, but it is. Why? 1 degree is an average. Many places have already gotten\nmuch warmer than that. Some places in the Arctic \nhave already warmed 4 degrees. If global average temperatures \nincrease 1 more degree, the coldest nights in the Arctic\nmight get 10 degrees warmer. The warmest days in Mumbai \nmight get 5 degrees hotter. So how did we get here? Almost everything that makes modern life\npossible relies on fossil fuels: coal, oil, and gas full of carbon \nfrom ancient organic matter. When we burn fossil fuels, we release carbon dioxide \nthat builds up in our atmosphere, where it remains for hundreds \nor even thousands of years, letting heat in, but not out. The heat comes from sunlight, which passes\nthrough the atmosphere to Earth, where it gets absorbed \nand warms everything up. Warm objects emit infrared radiation,\nwhich should pass back out into space, because most atmospheric gases \ndon’t absorb it. But greenhouse gases—\ncarbon dioxide and methane— do absorb infrared wavelengths. So when we add more of those gases \nto the atmosphere, less heat makes it back out to space, \nand our planet warms up. If we keep emitting greenhouse gases \nat our current pace, scientists predict temperatures\nwill rise 4 degrees from their pre-industrial levels by 2100. They’ve identified 1.5 degrees of warming— global averages half a degree warmer \nthan today’s— as a threshold beyond which \nthe negative impacts of climate change will become increasingly severe. To keep from crossing that threshold, we need to get our greenhouse gas \nemissions down to zero as fast as possible. Or rather, we have to get emissions\ndown to what's called net zero, meaning we may still be putting some\ngreenhouse gases into the atmosphere, but we take out as much as we put in. This doesn’t mean we can just keep \nemitting and sequester all that carbon— we couldn’t keep up with our emissions \nthrough natural methods, and technological solutions would\nbe prohibitively expensive and require huge amounts\nof permanent storage. Instead, while we switch \nfrom coal, oil, and natural gas to clean energy and fuels, \nwhich will take time, we can mitigate the damage by removing\ncarbon from the atmosphere. Jumping out of the proverbial pot \nisn’t an option, but we can do something the frogs can’t: reach over, and turn down the heat."

    "content": "In the fight to curb climate change, there are few solutions more discussed\nthan planting lots and lots of trees. It sounds simple enough— trees absorb\nCO2 from the atmosphere to grow, so planting more of them should help\neliminate greenhouse gases. The trouble is, tree planting efforts\ndon't always work as planned. For example, between 1974 and 2012, the Chilean government helped\nfund the planting of over a million hectares of new trees. Yet a recent analysis suggests\nthis multi-million dollar effort resulted in no major carbon storage gains. What went wrong? Chile focused on afforestation: the planting of trees in places long\ndevoid of— or never home to— any forest, as opposed to reforestation, the practice of restoring recently\ndegraded forests. Many governments and international\norganizations champion afforestation in their efforts to meet\nlofty tree planting goals that require massive amounts of land. The Bonn Challenge, launched in 2011\nby the German government and the International Union\nfor Conservation of Nature, aims to restore 350 million hectares\nof degraded land across the globe by 2030, in part through afforestation. Many companies have also seized\non tree planting to offset emissions and, in some cases, negative PR from their\ncontributions to the climate emergency. A 2021 Oxfam analysis found that the area\nneeded to match the tree planting goals set by four of the largest\noil and gas producers would require land twice the size\nof the UK. Here's where things get complicated. In order to be a long-term carbon sink, trees need to grow to maturity\nand stay put. Most of Chile's afforestation funding went\nto the commercial forestry industry, which drastically expanded plantations\nof mostly non-native trees— in some cases even by plowing\ninto native forests. According to one study, on average, natural forests are 40 times better\nat carbon storage than plantations. A mature tree can absorb up to\n22 kilograms of carbon dioxide each year. But plantation trees are harvested. Further, pine and eucalyptus—\ntwo commonly grown plantation trees— are highly flammable, so gains in carbon storage\ncan quickly go up in smoke. And not all land should be forested. In 2019, researchers estimated that,\nof the 100 million hectares of land targeted for a tree planting initiative\nin Africa, most is savanna. Dropping trees into Africa’s savannas\nthreatens wildlife that thrive in sunlight and open spaces. And wildfires,\nnot to mention a passing elephant, can quickly stomp out years\nof tree growth. Meanwhile, a savanna’s natural vegetation\ntucks most of its carbon safely away below ground, where it’s protected\nfrom fire and hungry herbivores. Planting trees can also have\nunintended consequences in places that naturally reflect sunlight like drylands or snowy terrain. Trees in these regions could absorb\nmore of the Sun’s rays, contributing to a warmer planet. It’s not that we shouldn’t\nplant more trees. But for the best chance of success, programs should consider which\nspecies to plant, which lands to forest, and how to protect the land long-term. Today, Chile is prioritizing planting\nnative trees rather than timber plantations. Some researchers argue that a more\nefficient way to re-green the planet is to protect forests\nand let nature do the work. On recently deforested land, seeds wait in soil and new sprouts grow\nfrom old stumps. As time passes, birds and winds\ndeliver seeds from forests nearby. Others support programs that practice\nassisted natural regeneration— helping nature along by removing grasses\nthat compete with saplings, preventing grazing,\nand even planting trees in small patches. So when is it bad to plant trees? When programs put the wrong trees\nin the wrong places. It’s bad when it’s mistakenly used\nas a catch-all solution, rather than addressing more\ncomplex issues like carbon emissions and active deforestation. It’s also bad to plant trees when it\nallows companies and governments to practice greenwashing, throwing money at initiatives that\nhave no real chance of achieving the carbon offsets they promise. The best investments in a greener future\nare to cut carbon emissions, while protecting these forests from being\ndestroyed in the first place."

    "content": "You've probably heard that carbon dioxide is warming the Earth, but how does it work? Is it like the glass of a greenhouse or like an insulating blanket? Well, not entirely. The answer involves a bit of quantum mechanics, but don't worry, we'll start with a rainbow. If you look closely at sunlight separated through a prism, you'll see dark gaps where bands of color went missing. Where did they go? Before reaching our eyes, different gases absorbed those specific parts of the spectrum. For example, oxygen gas snatched up some of the dark red light, and sodium grabbed two bands of yellow. But why do these gases absorb specific colors of light? This is where we enter the quantum realm. Every atom and molecule has a set number of possible energy levels for its electrons. To shift its electrons from the ground state to a higher level, a molecule needs to gain a certain amount of energy. No more, no less. It gets that energy from light, which comes in more energy levels than you could count. Light consists of tiny particles called photons and the amount of energy in each photon corresponds to its color. Red light has lower energy and longer wavelengths. Purple light has higher energy and shorter wavelengths. Sunlight offers all the photons of the rainbow, so a gas molecule can choose the photons that carry the exact amount of energy needed to shift the molecule to its next energy level. When this match is made, the photon disappers as the molecule gains its energy, and we get a small gap in our rainbow. If a photon carries too much or too little energy, the molecule has no choice but to let it fly past. This is why glass is transparent. The atoms in glass do not pair well with any of the energy levels in visible light, so the photons pass through. So, which photons does carbon dioxide prefer? Where is the black line in our rainbow that explains global warming? Well, it's not there. Carbon dioxide doesn't absorb light directly from the Sun. It absorbs light from a totally different celestial body. One that doesn't appear to be emitting light at all: Earth. If you're wondering why our planet doesn't seem to be glowing, it's because the Earth doesn't emit visible light. It emits infared light. The light that our eyes can see, including all of the colors of the rainbow, is just a small part of the larger spectrum of electromagnetic radiation, which includes radio waves, microwaves, infrared, ultraviolet, x-rays, and gamma rays. It may seem strange to think of these things as light, but there is no fundamental difference between visible light and other electromagnetic radiation. It's the same energy, but at a higher or lower level. In fact, it's a bit presumptuous to define the term visible light by our own limitations. After all, infrared light is visible to snakes, and ultraviolet light is visible to birds. If our eyes were adapted to see light of 1900 megahertz, then a mobile phone would be a flashlight, and a cell phone tower would look like a huge lantern. Earth emits infrared radiation because every object with a temperature above absolute zero will emit light. This is called thermal radiation. The hotter an object gets, the higher frequency the light it emits. When you heat a piece of iron, it will emit more and more frequencies of infrared light, and then, at a temperature of around 450 degrees Celsius, its light will reach the visible spectrum. At first, it will look red hot. And with even more heat, it will glow white with all of the frequencies of visible light. This is how traditional light bulbs were designed to work and why they're so wasteful. 95% of the light they emit is invisible to our eyes. It's wasted as heat. Earth's infrared radiation would escape to space if there weren't greenhouse gas molecules in our atmophere. Just as oxygen gas prefers the dark red photons, carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases match with infrared photons. They provide the right amount of energy to shift the gas molecules into their higher energy level. Shortly after a carbon dioxide molecule absorbs an infrared photon, it will fall back to its previous energy level, and spit a photon back out in a random direction. Some of that energy then returns to Earth's surface, causing warming. The more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, the more likely that infrared photons will land back on Earth and change our climate."

    "content": "Imagine you live in a remote village\nwhere the only source of water is delivered monthly by truck. This, of course, costs money. But then you discover a massive\nwater source below the village: limitless water,\nbut currently unreachable. To access it, you’d need to dig a well. That would cost years’ worth\nof water trucking fees, But once built, you and all future\ngenerations would have unlimited water— for only the minor cost\nof maintaining the well. So, what’s the best way forward? Continue trucking in water?\nOr build the well? Is the trillion dollar price tag that comes with transitioning the world\nto clean energy worth the cost of investment? Like the trucked in water,\nfossil fuels aren't free. There are the costs of the actual fuels,\nwhich, adjusted for inflation, haven't changed much for 140 years. And then there are the costs\nof maintaining and updating our extensive fossil fuel infrastructure. On the other hand, the wind, water, and sunlight needed\nto power renewables are all free and in unlimited supply, just like the village’s\nnewly discovered water table. There’s just the upfront cost of building\ninfrastructure to harness them. To fully transition to a green economy, we'd also need to invest\nin electrifying entire industries, building new renewable energy plants, deploying large-scale\nenergy storage, and more. Back in the early 2000s, most economic models predicted\nthose costs to be completely impractical and prohibitively expensive. For example, one model estimated\nthat solar power would be about $157 per megawatt-hour\nin the 2020s, which is far more expensive\nthan coal was projected to cost. But a slow revolution has been happening\nover the past two decades. In the early 2000, some countries like\nGermany and China and some tech companies decided to invest huge sums of money\nin solar infrastructure. This led to more research and development, which brought the costs down far below what even the most optimistic model\nhad predicted. Today, solar is 84% cheaper than that\nearly model projected it would be— making it cheaper than power from coal\nin much of the world. This change is so dramatic that some\neconomists now think switching to renewable energy quickly\ncould save trillions of dollars in the next three decades—\ndespite the upfront cost. And of course, there’s another\nimportant cost to consider. Global warming is very, very expensive: extreme weather, rising sea levels,\ncrop failures, health issues, and industry disruptions\nall cost money. Coming back to our village example, it would be as if the more\nwater you truck in, the more that traffic degrades the road— ruts get deeper, sides erode, maybe part\nof it falls away in a landslide. Eventually the road would become unusable. Economists have also tried to predict\nhow expensive future warming will be. The widely cited DICE model posits that\nthe cost of climate change-induced damage rises approximately as a function\nof global average temperatures squared. So if temperatures rise by two degrees,\ncosts rise by roughly a factor of four. In other words, these models assume that\ncosts will rise smoothly and continuously.  But many economists today\nargue that assumption is wrong, because it ignores catastrophic\nevents like the collapse of the Amazon, melting of polar and Greenland ice, and widespread crop failures,\njust to name a few. Any of these would cause huge,\nsharp spikes in costs. In fact, the US government keeps track\nof climate disasters that incur more than $1 billion\nin damages, and since 1980 they’ve already\nrecorded 400 of these events. The total bill is estimated to be\nan eye-watering $2.8 trillion— just in the US. For decades, the argument in favor\nof transitioning to a green economy was “let’s take the financial hit now;\nit’s hard, but it’ll protect the world\nfor future generations.” But that argument relied on economic\nmodeling that underestimated the costs of a warming world and overestimated\nthe costs of transitioning. We now know the economic outlook\nis different. Making the investment to transition not only protects the world\nfor future generations,  it also saves us money\nin our own lifetime. It's just the most logical thing to do."

    "content": "Every year, the world uses \n35 billion barrels of oil. This massive scale of fossil fuel \ndependence pollutes the Earth and it won't last forever. Scientists estimate that we've consumed\nabout 40% of the world's oil. According to present estimates, at this rate, we'll run out of oil\nand gas in 50 years or so, and in about a century for coal. On the flip side, we have abundant\nsun, water, and wind. These are renewable energy sources, meaning that we won't use them up\nover time. What if we could exchange \nour fossil fuel dependence for an existence based \nsolely on renewables? We've pondered that question for decades, and yet, renewable energy still\nonly provides about 13% of our needs. That's because reaching 100% requires\nrenewable energy that's inexpensive and accessible. This represents a huge challenge, even if we ignore the politics involved\nand focus on the science and engineering. We can better understand the problem\nby understanding how we use energy. Global energy use is a diverse \nand complex system, and the different elements \nrequire their own solutions. But for now, we'll focus on two\nof the most familiar in everyday life: electricity and liquid fuels. Electricity powers blast furnaces, \nelevators, computers, and all manner of things in homes,\nbusinesses, and manufacturing. Meanwhile, liquid fuels \nplay a crucial role in almost all forms of transportation. Let's consider the electrical \nportion first. The great news is that our technology\nis already advanced enough to capture all that energy \nfrom renewables, and there's an ample supply. The sun continuously radiates about 173 quadrillion watts \nof solar energy at the Earth, which is almost 10,000 times\nour present needs. It's been estimated that a surface that\nspans several hundred thousand kilometers would be needed to power humanity\nat our present usage levels. So why don't we build that? Because there are other \nhurdles in the way, like efficiency and energy transportation. To maximize efficiency, solar plants must be located in areas \nwith lots of sunshine year round, like deserts. But those are far away \nfrom densely populated regions where energy demand is high. There are other forms of renewable energy\nwe could draw from, such as hydroelectric, geothermal, and biomasses, but they also have limits based on\navailability and location. In principle, a connected electrical\nenergy network with power lines crisscrossing the globe would enable us to transport power\nfrom where it's generated to where it's needed. But building a system on this scale\nfaces an astronomical price tag. We could lower the cost by developing\nadvanced technologies to capture energy more efficiently. The infrastructure for transporting energy\nwould also have to change drastically. Present-day power lines lose about 6-8%\nof the energy they carry because wire material dissipates energy\nthrough resistance. Longer power lines would mean\nmore energy loss. Superconductors could be one solution. Such materials can transport electricity\nwithout dissipation. Unfortunately, they only work\nif cooled to low temperatures, which requires energy \nand defeats the purpose. To benefit from that technology, we'd need to discover \nnew superconducting materials that operate at room temperature. And what about the all-important,\noil-derived liquid fuels? The scientific challenge there is to store\nrenewable energy in an easily transportable form. Recently, we've gotten better\nat producing lithium ion batteries, which are lightweight \nand have high-energy density. But even the best of these\nstore about 2.5 megajoules per kilogram. That's about 20 times less than the energy\nin one kilogram of gasoline. To be truly competitive, car batteries\nwould have to store much more energy without adding cost. The challenges only increase \nfor bigger vessels, like ships and planes. To power a cross-Atlantic \nflight for a jet, we'd need a battery weighing\nabout 1,000 tons. This, too, demands a technological leap\ntowards new materials, higher energy density, and better storage. One promising solution would be\nto find efficient ways to convert solar into chemical energy. This is already happening in labs, but the efficiency is still too low\nto allow it to reach the market. To find novel solutions, we'll need\nlots of creativity, innovation, and powerful incentives. The transition towards all-renewable \nenergies is a complex problem involving technology, \neconomics, and politics. Priorities on how to tackle this challenge\ndepend on the specific assumptions we have to make when trying to solve\nsuch a multifaceted problem. But there's ample reason to be optimistic\nthat we'll get there. Top scientific minds around the world\nare working on these problems and making breakthroughs all the time. And many governments and businesses\nare investing in technologies that harness the energy all around us."

    "content": "The Earth intercepts a lot of solar power: 173 thousand terawatts. That's ten thousand times more power\nthan the planet's population uses. So is it possible that one day the world could be completely \nreliant on solar energy? To answer that question, we first need to examine how solar panels\nconvert solar energy to electrical energy. Solar panels are made up of smaller units\ncalled solar cells. The most common solar cells\nare made from silicon, a semiconductor that is the second\nmost abundant element on Earth. In a solar cell, crystalline silicon is sandwiched\nbetween conductive layers. Each silicon atom is connected\nto its neighbors by four strong bonds, which keep the electrons in place\nso no current can flow. Here's the key: a silicon solar cell uses\ntwo different layers of silicon. An n-type silicon has extra electrons, and p-type silicon has extra spaces\nfor electrons, called holes. Where the two types of silicon meet, electrons can wander across \nthe p/n junction, leaving a positive charge on one side and creating negative charge on the other. You can think of light \nas the flow of tiny particles called photons, shooting out from the Sun. When one of these photons strikes\nthe silicon cell with enough energy, it can knock an electron from its bond,\nleaving a hole. The negatively charged electron and\nlocation of the positively charged hole are now free to move around. But because of the electric field\nat the p/n junction, they'll only go one way. The electron is drawn to the n-side, while the hole is drawn to the p-side. The mobile electrons are collected by\nthin metal fingers at the top of the cell. From there, they flow through \nan external circuit, doing electrical work, like powering a lightbulb, before returning through the conductive\naluminum sheet on the back. Each silicon cell only puts out\nhalf a volt, but you can string them \ntogether in modules to get more power. Twelve photovoltaic cells are enough\nto charge a cellphone, while it takes many modules \nto power an entire house. Electrons are the only moving parts\nin a solar cell, and they all go back where they came from. There's nothing to get worn out\nor used up, so solar cells can last for decades. So what's stopping us from being\ncompletely reliant on solar power? There are political factors at play, not to mention businesses that lobby\nto maintain the status quo. But for now, let's focus on the physical\nand logistical challenges, and the most obvious of those is that solar energy \nis unevenly distributed across the planet. Some areas are sunnier than others. It's also inconsistent. Less solar energy is available \non cloudy days or at night. So a total reliance would require efficient ways to get electricity \nfrom sunny spots to cloudy ones, and effective storage of energy. The efficiency of the cell itself\nis a challenge, too. If sunlight is reflected \ninstead of absorbed, or if dislodged electrons fall back into\na hole before going through the circuit, that photon's energy is lost. The most efficient solar cell yet still only converts 46% of \nthe available sunlight to electricity, and most commercial systems are currently\n15-20% efficient. In spite of these limitations, it actually would be possible to power the entire world \nwith today's solar technology. We'd need the funding \nto build the infrastructure and a good deal of space. Estimates range from tens \nto hundreds of thousands of square miles, which seems like a lot, but the Sahara Desert alone is over\n3 million square miles in area. Meanwhile, solar cells are getting\nbetter, cheaper, and are competing \nwith electricity from the grid. And innovations, like floating solar farms,\nmay change the landscape entirely. Thought experiments aside, there's the fact \nthat over a billion people don't have access \nto a reliable electric grid, especially in developing countries, many of which are sunny. So in places like that, solar energy is already much cheaper\nand safer than available alternatives, like kerosene. For say, Finland or Seattle, though, effective solar energy \nmay still be a little way off."

    "content": "No matter how we make electricity,\nit takes up space. Electricity from coal requires mines,\nand plants to burn it and convert the heat into electricity. Nuclear power takes uranium mines,\nfacilities to refine the uranium, a reactor, and a place to store \nthe spent fuel safely. Renewable energy needs wind turbines \nor solar panels. How much space depends\non the power source. Say you wanted to power a 10-watt \nlight bulb with fossil fuels like coal. Fossil fuels can produce \nup to 2,000 watts per square meter, so it would only take a credit card-sized\nchunk of land to power the light bulb. With nuclear power, you might only\nneed an area about the size of the palms of your hands. With solar power, you’d need at least\n0.3 square meters of land— twice the size of a cafeteria tray. Wind power would take roughly\n7 square meters— about half the size of a parking space— \nto power the bulb. When you consider the space needed \nto power cities, countries, and the whole world,\nit adds up fast. Today, the world uses 3 trillion watts \nof electricity. To power the entire world \nwith only fossil fuels, you’d need at least about 1,200\nsquare kilometers of space— roughly the area of Grand Bahama island. With nuclear energy, you’d need almost\nfour times as much space at a minimum— roughly 4,000 square kilometers, \na little less than the area of Delaware. With solar, you’d need at least\n95,000 square kilometers, approximately the area of South Korea. With wind power, you’d need two million—\nabout the area of Mexico. For each power source, there’s variability\nin how much power it can generate per square meter, but these numbers give us a general\nsense of the space needed. Of course, building energy infrastructure\nin a desert, a rainforest, a town, or even in the ocean \nare completely different prospects. And energy sources monopolize the space \nthey occupy to very different extents. Take wind power. Wind turbines need to be spread out—\nsometimes half a kilometer apart— so that the turbulence from one turbine doesn’t reduce the efficiency \nof the others. So, much of the land needed \nto generate wind power is still available for other uses. But the baseline amount of space\nstill matters, because cities and other densely populated\nareas have high electricity demands, and space near them is often limited. Our current power infrastructure \nworks best when electricity is generated\nwhere and when it’s needed, rather than being stored or sent\nacross long distances. Still, space demands are only\npart of the equation. As of 2020, 2/3 of our electricity\ncomes from fossil fuels. Every year, electricity generation \nis responsible for about 27% of the more than 50 billion tons \nof greenhouse gases we add to the atmosphere, accelerating climate change \nand all its harms. So although fossil fuels require the least\nspace of our existing technologies, we can’t continue to rely on them. Cost is another consideration. Nuclear plants don’t emit greenhouse gases\nand don’t require much space, but they’re way more expensive to build\nthan solar panels or wind turbines, and have waste to deal with. Renewables have almost no marginal costs— unlike with plants powered \nby fossil fuels, you don’t need to keep purchasing fuel \nto generate electricity. But you do need lots of wind and sunlight, which are more available in some places \nthan others. No single approach will be\nthe best option to power the entire world while eliminating\nharmful greenhouse gas emissions. For some places, nuclear power\nmight be the best option for replacing fossil fuels. Others, like the U.S., \nhave the natural resources to get most or all of their electricity \nfrom renewables. And across the board, we should be working\nto make our power sources better: safer in the case of nuclear, and easier to store and transport \nin the case of renewables."

    "content": "Every day, the sands of the Sahara Desert\nreach temperatures up to 80° Celsius. Stretching over roughly\nnine million square kilometers, this massive desert receives about \n22 million terawatt hours of energy from the Sun every year. That’s well over 100 times more energy \nthan humanity consumes annually. So, could covering the desert with solar \npanels solve our energy problems for good? Solar panels work when light particles hit\ntheir surface with enough energy to knock electrons \nout of their stable bonds. On their journey back to stability, \nthese electrons produce electricity. However, there’s a limit to how much power\npanels can generate. Solar panels can only interact \nwith certain wavelengths of light, making it impossible to convert \nover half the sunlight they receive. And even light particles they can convert\noften bounce off them without ever hitting an electron. But thanks to clever scientists \nand engineers and substantial government investment, solar panels are generating \nmore electricity than ever. Anti-reflective coatings and patterns \non the panels’ surface create more opportunities for incoming \nlight particles to hit electrons. These techniques have increased commercial\nsolar panel efficiency from the low-teens to 25%, with experimental models reaching\nup to 47%. What’s more, solar has gotten \n89% cheaper over the last decade, thanks in part to global supply chains\nfor other technologies that use the same materials. Together, these factors have \nmade solar power the cheapest source of electricity \non Earth. Countries including India, China, \nEgypt, and the US, have already taken\nthese new panels into the desert. Their massive solar farms range \nfrom 15 to 56 square kilometers, and when the sun is high in the sky, these plants can provide energy for hundreds of thousands\nof local residents. But these farms also get\nextremely hot. Light that solar cells don’t convert \nor reflect is absorbed as heat, which reduces a panel’s efficiency. And the cooling systems employed by many\nfarms can use huge amounts of energy powering fans or moving water \nto maintain optimal temperatures. Even with these systems, solar panels \nin the desert absorb far more heat than the natural sandy environment. This hasn’t been a problem\non the scale of existing solar farms. But if we tried to cover the Sahara, this effect could create massive changes\nin the region's climate. Constructing solar farms already\ndisrupts local ecosystems, but a plant of this scale could \ndramatically transform the desert landscape. Thankfully, solar panels\naren’t our only option. And some of the largest solar plants \nin the world are trying a new approach: giant mirrors. Morocco’s Noor Power Plant, which will eventually cover roughly \n30 square kilometers of the Sahara, is a concentrated solar power plant. This design reflects light \nonto a receiver, which converts that energy to heat,\nand then electricity. These mirrors still create a dangerous\ntemperature shift for local wildlife, but they have less potential\nto transform the landscape. And since it takes time for the materials\nbeing heated to cool off, these plants often continue producing\nelectricity past sunset. Whether they use panels or mirrors, industrial solar farms are often easy to\nfit into existing energy infrastructure. However, getting their electricity beyond\nlocal power grids is much more difficult. Some countries are working on ways to\nconnect electric grids across the globe. And many farm store energy\nin massive batteries, or convert their electricity \ninto clean gas that can be used later. But right now, these techniques are still\ntoo expensive and inefficient to rely on. Worse still, industrial renewables\ncan share some of the same problems as fossil fuels, relying on destructive mining operations \nand carbon-emitting global supply chains. Fortunately, solar can\nexist on many scales, from industrial solar farms \nto smaller installations that power individual buildings \nand rural communities. These projects can supplement energy use\nor provide a passive source of energy for regions off the grid. And since solar panels rely \non a few simple components, they’re quick to install \nand relatively easy to update. In fact, it’s this flexibility \nthat enabled solar to become so cheap and ubiquitous \nover the last decade. So if we want to keep up with humanity's\nrising energy use, we'll need answers both big and small."

    "content": "In the spring of 1954, the press excitedly gathered around\nBell Laboratories’ latest invention— a silicon-based solar cell\nthat could efficiently convert the sun's energy into electrical current. The creation was celebrated\nas the dawn of a new era, as reporters touted that civilization\nwould soon run on the sun’s limitless energy. But the dream had a catch,\nas this first commercially sold solar cell cost around $300 per watt, meaning at its current rate, it would cost well over a million\nto buy a unit large enough to power a single home. But today in many countries solar is the cheapest form\nof energy to produce, surpassing fossil fuel alternatives\nlike coal and natural gas. Millions of homes are equipped\nwith rooftop solar, with most units paying for themselves\nin their first 7 to 12 years and then generating further savings. So how did solar become so affordable? A turning point in solar’s\nprice history occurred on the floor of Germany’s parliament,\nwhere in 2000, Herman Scheer introduced \nthe Renewable Energy Sources Act. This legislation laid out a vision\nfor the country’s energy future in solar and wind. It incentivized citizens to personally\ninvest in rooftop solar panels by guaranteeing payment to homeowners\nfor the renewable energy they generated and sold to the grid. The pay rate for this electricity was\nhighly subsidized, at times reaching four times\nthe market price. Several other countries soon\nfollowed Germany’s example, implementing similar\npolicies and incentives to drive their country’s solar use. This created unprecedented demand\nfor solar panels worldwide. Manufacturers were\nable to scale up production and innovate in ways that cut costs. As a result, solar panel prices dropped,\nwhile efficiency grew. Today, a 46-square-meter rooftop\nsolar unit is often efficient enough to fully power a home, and this residential unit\nno longer costs millions— in the US in 2022,  the average\nconsumer cost of a rooftop solar unit ranged from around $17,000 to $23,000. These prices dropped by over 60%\nbetween 2010 and 2020 alone. So how much money can you save\nby switching to solar? US solar equipped homeowners\ncan save around $1,500 per year on their energy bills, equating to a net savings of $10,000\nto $30,000 during the unit’s lifetime. Month-to-month savings\ntend to vary, based on the amount of direct sunlight \nyour panel receives, weather conditions, and the price\nof electricity where you live. But not everyone can get solar. Adopting solar can be difficult\nfor renters, and in many countries, more than 25% of adults don’t own\ntheir own homes. Even if you do, your roof must meet\ncertain orientation and tilt requirements to make solar a worthwhile investment. And while units often pay for themselves\nthrough offset energy costs, the initial purchase and installation\nprice for solar can be expensive. But several companies have adopted\nsolar leasing models, where they finance the material costs, installation, and upkeep\nof the rooftop systems. Homeowners can then buy the panel’s\ngenerated electricity at a fixed rate that’s generally lower\nthan the local utility’s price. Still, many are working\ntowards community-based solutions, which would enable entire neighborhoods\nto profit from solar use. Europe is home to more than 7,000\ncommunity energy associations, where local members collectively\ninvest in wind turbines and solar panels to power their local grid. In 2005, the German town of Wolfhagen\ncreated an 800 member citizens co-op, which communally invested $2.84 million to buy up 25% of the local energy company and expand its renewables program. Today, its turbines and panels\ngenerate enough energy to meet the town’s needs and then some. Surplus energy is sold\nto neighboring towns, and profits are reinvested\nback into the community. For many, the appeal of solar\ngoes beyond just savings. Homes equipped with it are\nmore climate resilient, because they can be protected\nfrom utility grid outages and brownouts. Not to mention solar’s key role\nin decarbonizing the energy grid. By working together with larger-scale\nwind and solar farms, rooftop solar units help reduce\nour reliance on fossil fuels, paving the way for a cleaner\nand more reliable energy future."

    "content": "Every 24 hours, wind generates \nenough kinetic energy to produce roughly 35 times more \nelectricity than humanity uses each day. And unlike coal or oil, this resource\nis totally renewed each day. So how can we harness this incredible\namount of energy, and is it possible to create a world\npowered entirely by wind? The basic principle of wind energy \nis simple. A series of sails or blades\nmounted around a rotor catch the wind and translate its kinetic energy \ninto rotational energy. Traditional windmills use that rotational\nenergy to grind wheat or pump water. But in modern wind turbines, it turns \na generator that creates electricity. This conversion from wind \nto rotational energy to electricity has defined wind turbines since their \ninvention in the late 19th century. And there are three primary factors \nthat determine just how much energy they can produce: the size and orientation\nof the blades, the blade’s aerodynamic design, \nand the amount of wind turning the rotor. First up, blade orientation. Wind turbines can be designed \nwith their rotor on a vertical axis or a horizontal axis. Vertical blades can pick up wind \ncoming from any direction, but with much less efficiency\nthan horizontal axis rotors. Horizontal designs allow blades to capture\nthe wind’s full force by tracking the wind’s direction \nand turning to face it. This turning process is called yawing, and older windmills achieved it\nthrough manual monitoring. Today, wind sensors and computer systems\nautomatically adjust the blades with expert precision\nto capture as much energy as possible. Outside rotor orientation, the blades themselves need to be\nshaped to maximize efficiency. While early designs used flat blades, modern blades are curved\nlike airplane wings. Wind travels faster over\nthe curved surface, creating a low-pressure pocket \nabove the blade that forces it upwards. Since the amount of lift depends\non the angle at which the wind is moving \nrelative to the blade, modern blades also incorporate a twist, optimizing how much of the blade can cut\ninto the wind. Made of fiberglass and resin layers, \nthese blades are strong enough to operate through rain, lightning, \nand blistering sunlight for over 20 years. Even with aerodynamic blades\nand a horizontal rotor, a wind turbine can only capture wind\nif it's in a windy environment. Wind speeds typically increase the higher\ninto the atmosphere you travel. So today, most turbines are well\nover 100 meters tall, with equally large rotor diameters. A turbine of this height and size can\ncapture a huge amount of wind, generating enough electricity every\nyear to power 750 American homes. A wind farm of 200 similarly sized \nturbines could power over 150,000 American homes—\nor twice as many European homes— for an entire year. Offshore wind farms contain an even\ngreater number of even larger turbines. In 2019, the largest wind turbine \never built began operating off the coast \nof the Netherlands. With a rotor diameter of 220 meters,\njust one of these turbines can meet the annual power needs \nof 16,000 European households. Despite its amazing potential, \nwind energy still faces challenges. Wind may be a free and unlimited fuel, but no matter how large or efficient \na turbine is there's a mathematical limit to how much\nwind it can convert into electricity. German physicist Albert Betz calculated that since some wind must remain \nto keep the blades spinning, a turbine can only ever capture 59.3% \nof the wind’s energy. Additionally, some people feel turbines\ndisrupt natural scenery, and wind energy’s intermittent \navailability can make it difficult to integrate \ninto electrical grids. But even with these challenges,\nmodern wind turbines have made wind energy the most efficient and inexpensive \nsource of electricity. Wind turbines already provide essential\nenergy for communities around the world. And for many farmers, \nhosting a wind turbine can be a reliable source \nof additional income. With continued improvements\nin wind forecasting, electrical grid infrastructure\nand energy storage, wind power might blow away\nall our energy problems."

    "content": "Energy is all around us, a physical quantity that follows\nprecise natural laws. Our universe has a finite amount of it; it's neither created nor destroyed but can take different forms, such as kinetic or potential energy, with different properties\nand formulas to remember. For instance, an LED desk lamp's 6 Watt bulb transfers 6 Joules\nof light energy per second. But let's jump back up into space to look at our planet,\nits systems, and their energy flow. Earth's physical systems include the atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, and biosphere. Energy moves in and out of these systems, and during any energy\ntransfer between them, some is lost to the surroundings, as heat, light, sound, vibration, or movement. Our planet's energy comes from\ninternal and external sources. Geothermal energy\nfrom radioactive isotopes and rotational energy\nfrom the spinning of the Earth are internal sources of energy, while the Sun\nis the major external source, driving certain systems,\nlike our weather and climate. Sunlight warms the surface and atmosphere\nin varying amounts, and this causes convection, producing winds\nand influencing ocean currents. Infrared radiation, radiating out\nfrom the warmed surface of the Earth, gets trapped by greenhouse gases\nand further affects the energy flow. The Sun is also the major source\nof energy for organisms. Plants, algae, and cyanobacteria use sunlight to produce organic matter from carbon dioxide and water, powering the biosphere's food chains. We release this food energy\nusing chemical reactions, like combustion and respiration. At each level in a food chain,\nsome energy is stored in newly made chemical structures, but most is lost to the surroundings, as heat, like your body heat, released by your digestion of food. Now, as plants are eaten\nby primary consumers, only about 10% of their total energy\nis passed on to the next level. Since energy can only flow\nin one direction in a food chain, from producers on to consumers\nand decomposers, an organism that eats lower\non the food chain, is more efficient than one higher up. So eating producers\nis the most efficient level at which an animal can get its energy, but without continual input of energy\nto those producers, mostly from sunlight, life on Earth as we know it\nwould cease to exist. We humans, of course, spend our energy\ndoing a lot of things besides eating. We travel, we build, we power\nall sorts of technology. To do all this, we use sources like fossil fuels: coal, oil, and natural gas, which contain energy that plants captured\nfrom sunlight long ago and stored in the form of carbon. When we burn fossil fuels in power plants, we release this stored energy to generate electricity. To generate electricity, heat from burning fossil fuels\nis used to power turbines that rotate magnets, which, in turn, create\nmagnetic field changes relative to a coil of wire, causing electrons to be\ninduced to flow in the wire. Modern civilization depends on our ability to keep powering that flow of electrons. Fortunately, we aren't limited\nto burning non-renewable fossil fuels to generate electricity. Electrons can also be induced to flow by direct interaction\nwith light particles, which is how a solar cell operates. Other renewable energy sources, such as wind, water, geothermal, and biofuels can also be used to generate electricity. Global demand for energy is increasing, but the planet\nhas limited energy resources to access through a complex\nenergy infrastructure. As populations rise, alongside rates of industrialization\nand development, our energy decisions grow\nmore and more important. Access to energy\nimpacts health, education, political power, and socioeconomic status. If we improve our energy efficiency, we can use our natural resources\nmore responsibly and improve quality of life for everyone."

    "content": "You flip a switch. Coal burns in a furnace,\nwhich turns water into steam. That steam spins a turbine,\nwhich activates a generator, which pushes electrons\nthrough the wire. This current propagates through hundreds\nof miles of electric cables and arrives at your home. All around the world, countless people \nare doing this every second— flipping a switch, plugging in, \npressing an “on” button. So how much electricity \ndoes humanity need? The amount we collectively use\nis changing fast, so to answer this question, we need to know not just how much \nthe world uses today, but how much we’ll use in the future. The first step is understanding\nhow we measure electricity. It’s a little bit tricky. A joule is a unit of energy, but we usually don't measure\nelectricity in just joules. Instead, we measure it in watts. Watts tell us how much energy, \nper second, it takes to power something. One joule per second\nequals one watt. It takes about .1 watts\nto power a smart phone, a thousand to power your house,\na million for a small town, and a billion for a mid-size city. As of 2020, it takes 3 trillion watts\nto power the entire world. But almost a billion people don’t have\naccess to reliable electricity. As countries become more industrialized\nand more people join the grid, electricity demand is expected \nto increase about 80% by 2050. That number isn't the complete picture. We'll also have to use electricity\nin completely new ways. Right now, we power a lot of things\nby burning fossil fuels, emitting an unsustainable amount \nof greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming. We’ll have to eliminate \nthese emissions entirely to ensure a sustainable future \nfor humanity. The first step to doing so,\nfor many industries, is to switch from fossil fuels \nto electric power. We'll need to electrify cars, switch buildings heated by natural gas\nfurnaces to electric heat pumps, and electrify the huge amount of heat\nused in industrial processes. So all told, global electricity needs\ncould triple by 2050. We’ll also need all that electricity \nto come from clean energy sources if it’s going to solve the problems \ncaused by fossil fuels. Today, only one third of the electricity\nwe generate comes from clean sources. Fossil fuels are cheap and convenient, \neasy to ship, and easy to turn into electricity \non demand. So how can we close the gap? Wind and solar power work great\nfor places with lots of wind and sunshine, but we can’t store and ship sunlight \nor wind the way we can transport oil. To make full use of energy from these \nsources at other times or in other places, we’d have to store it in batteries and improve our power grid infrastructure\nto transport it long distances. Meanwhile, nuclear power plants \nuse nuclear fission to generate carbon-free electricity. Though still more expensive\nthan plants that burn fossil fuels, they can be built anywhere and don’t depend on intermittent \nenergy sources like the sun or wind. Researchers are currently working \nto improve nuclear waste disposal and the safety of nuclear plants. There’s another possibility we’ve been \ntrying to crack since the 1940s: nuclear fusion. It involves smashing light atoms together,\nso they fuse, and harnessing the energy this releases. Accidents aren't a concern\nwith nuclear fusion, and it doesn't produce the long-lived\nradioactive waste fission does. It also doesn’t have \nthe transport concerns associated with wind, solar, \nand other renewable energy sources. A major breakthrough here could\nrevolutionize clean energy. The same is true of nuclear fission, \nsolar, and wind. Breakthroughs in any \nof these technologies, and especially in all of them together,\ncan change the world: not only helping us triple \nour electricity supply, but enabling us to sustain it."

    "content": "While the weather in Iceland is\noften cold, wet, and windy, a nearly endless supply of heat bubbles\naway below the surface. In fact, almost every building in the \ncountry is heated by geothermal energy, in a process with virtually\nno carbon emissions. So how exactly does this renewable energy\nwork? Between the Earth’s core and its crust \nis a mixed layer of solid and partially molten rock \ncalled the mantle. Temperatures here range\nfrom 1,000 to 3,500 degrees Celsius. Some of this heat comes from the\nradioactive decay of metals. But much of it comes from Earth’s core, which has been radiating energy \nsince the planet formed over four billion years ago. While the mantle moves slowly, circulating roughly 40 kilometers \nbelow the Earth’s crust, there are places where\nit surges closer to the surface. Here, the magma forms pockets\nand veins in the ground, heating underground rivers and pools \nto temperatures reaching 300 degrees. Controlling heated water is at the heart\nof harnessing geothermal energy, and there are two primary models \nfor how to do it. One is to build a geothermal power plant which uses these hot, deep pools \nto produce electricity. First, engineers drill a well several\nkilometers into permeable rock like sandstone or basalt. As the hot, highly pressurized groundwater\nflows into the well, the rapid change in pressure \nand temperature produces huge amounts of steam. This steam then turns the blades \nof a turbine to generate electricity. Finally, the remaining cooled water\nand condensed steam are injected back into the ground \nto create an open loop that provides electricity\nwithout losing water. However, we don't have to drill this deep\nto take advantage of the planet's heat. Thanks to solar radiation, dirt just 1.5 meters deep can reach\ntemperatures over 20 degrees Celsius. Geothermal heat pumps pipe water\nor antifreeze liquid through this layer of earth \nto siphon its energy. These liquids are then pumped \nthrough local infrastructure, dispersing their heat before\nmoving back through the ground to absorb more energy. While external electricity is needed \nto operate the pumps, the energy provided is far greater \nthan the energy used, meaning this process is also\na sustainable loop. In fact, geothermal heat pumps\nare both cheaper to operate and at least two times more energy\nefficient than fossil fuel equivalents. Whether geothermal energy is radiating\njust below our feet, or heating water several kilometers deep, the planet is constantly radiating heat. Averaged across one year, Earth gives off roughly three times more\nenergy than humanity consumes. So why does geothermal only account \nfor 0.2% of humanity’s energy production? The answer has to do with heat,\nlocation, and cost. Since geothermal heat pumps rely \non the consistent heat found in shallow earth, they can be implemented almost anywhere. But geothermal power plants require\ntapping into high-temperature geothermal fields; regions hotter than 180 degrees and \ntypically several kilometres underground. These high temperature zones\nare hard to find, and drilling this deep for just one \nof the several wells a plant will need can cost up to $20 million. There are regions with shallower\ngeothermal fields. Iceland and Japan are near active \nvolcanoes and tectonic plate boundaries, where magma rises up through the crust. But these same factors also make \nthose regions prone to earthquakes, which can also be triggered\nby intensive drilling. Furthermore, while geothermal energy\nis clean and renewable, it’s not entirely harmless. Drilling can release vapors containing\npollutants like methane and hydrogen sulfide. And drilling tools that use pressurized \nwater can contaminate groundwater. Fortunately, new technologies are emerging\nto meet these challenges. Emission control systems\ncan capture pollutants, and electromagnetic monitoring can\nhelp detect seismic risks. We're also uncovering entirely new\nsources of geothermal energy, like pockets of magma \nin mid-ocean volcanoes. So if we can safely and responsibly tap\ninto the heat sustaining our planet, we might be able to sustain\nhumanity as well."

    "content": "- [Narrator] Glaciers have been shaping our world for millions of years. But as climate change warms the planet, glaciers are disappearing, not\nonly altering the landscapes they leave behind, but\nchanging our oceans, weather, and life on earth as we know it. A glacier is a huge mass of ice\nthat moves slowly over land. Glaciers can be classified\ninto two general groups alpine glaciers and ice sheets. Alpine glaciers form on mountainsides and move downward through valleys. Sometimes, they create\nvalleys by pushing dirt, soil, and other materials out of their way. These glaciers are found on every continent except Australia. Ice sheets, unlike alpine glaciers, are not limited to mountainous areas. They form broad domes and spread out from their centers in all directions. As ice sheets spread, they\ncover everything around them with a thick blanket of\nice, including valleys, plains, and even entire mountains. The largest ice sheets are\ncalled continental glaciers. They cover vast area\nincluding most of Antarctica and the island of Greenland. Glaciers can form over years when more snow piles up and melts. Soon after falling, the\nsnow begins to become denser and more tightly packed. When new snow falls and buries\nthe previous years snow, the bottom layer becomes\neven more compressed. The dense, grainy ice that has survived one year's melt cycle is called firn. When the ice grows thick\nenough, the firn grains fuse into a huge mass called glacial ice. The glacier may begin to\nmove under its own weight, through a process called\ncompression melting. As they move, glaciers erode or wear away the land beneath and around them. When glaciers began their latest retreat less than 20,000 years\nago, they left behind many landscape features, such as lakes, valleys, and mountains. Glaciers provide people\nwith many useful resources. Glacial till provides fertile\nsoil for growing crops. And, deposits of sand and gravel are used to make concrete and asphalt. Many rivers are fed by the\nmelting ice of glaciers. The most important resource provided by glaciers is freshwater. Earth's average temperature\nhas been increasing dramatically for more than a century. Glaciers can act as\nindicators of global warming and climate change in several ways. Melting ice sheets contribute\nto rising sea levels. As ice sheets in Antarctica\nand Greenland melt, they raise sea levels, adding fresh water to the ocean every day. The loss of glacial ice\nalso reduces the amount of fresh water available for\nplants and animals on land. Large additions of fresh water change the ocean ecosystem,\nas well ocean currents. Additionally, less salt\nin the ocean could disturb the gulf stream, drastically changing the weather on land as well. Since glaciers are so\nsensitive to climate change, the increased speed of glacier melt is an early warning system\nfor the rest of the planet. And if global warming goes\nunchecked, many, if not all, alpine glaciers could\ndisappear completely. (soft entertaining music)"

me and they said you need to cut your surfing trip short and come to Paris to interview president macron for the one Planet polar Summit so here I am in the city of love not to get engaged but instead to talk with the president and leading scientists uh about icebergs and very lovely cold [Music] places turns out you can't go and meet a president in your flip-flops so it's time to get changed now I got to remember to tie a tie send help okay tie complete got dolphins on it very on brand National Geographic okay I think we're ready let's do this well here we go here at the Natural History Museum in Paris for the one Planet polar Summit and I'm glad to not be wearing flip-flops anymore yeah excited as a wildlife filmmaker I'm always looking for new ways to make a positive impact so to speak with president macron was a real honor and an exciting opportunity especially as he is vocal about finding Global solutions to The Climate [Music] crisis my name is berti Gregory I'm a wild filmmaker with National Geographic and very good thanks i' just like to start by showing you a quick video a very special group of Antarctic Kow whales that use teamwork to create waves to wash seals off the ice so these seals would otherwise be Out Of Reach for these kilow whales but together they create waves to wash the seals into the water these Kow whales are in trouble there's only 100 of them in existence and they're declining because their SE ice home is is disappearing I've seen many world leaders talk about the environment and I don't always believe that they genuinely care but when I watch you I get the impression that you do genuinely care and so I'm curious to know where does your passion your love for the en environment come from how did that originate look I I'm I I'm converted no no but sincerely I was not initially as a politician I worked very hard on Africa and different countries and I was shocked by how much climate change and crisis of biodiversity is impacting first most vulnerable countries and poor and emerging countries you cannot build something strong in an unfair World second I don't believe for our children that we will build something sustainable if we don't care human dignity is number one but Humanity cannot survive without biodiversity and sustainable climate and for his scold political strategy I expected this spot right here to be full of ice not just icebergs but sea ice this whole area Frozen and it's not this year is different you've been very good at positioning France as a world leader in the conversation with climate crisis and protecting polar regions we're having a discussion but we're much more interested in the doing so I'm curious to know how do you envision France's role in in protecting these polar regions and fighting climate crisis what we want to do is to fight for cryosphere glaas poles and so on so the first way to do it is to protect our own place one 100% of our glasses are already protected but just 60% have the high level of protection so we will go from 60% to 100% second we build this Coalition precisely to engage a lot of countries to work with us on Research we have to launch a big research program to push countries to make action I decided to invest 1 billion on our polar strategy for Arctic and Antarctic so here are a few examples of the very clear commitments research protection and so on sea ice has been steadily disappearing over the last decade you might think this place looks cold but Antarctica is one of the fastest warming regions on Earth this issue is is bigger than France it requires a huge amount of global cooperation how are you going to bring all these countries together I think the main message was to say cryosphere is already address and this is a big issue for all of us tomorrow it will be your problem as well so this is a scientific discussion scientific cooperation and this is where it's important to work beyond the craziness of this time with all the different big Powers now the critical points and where we would have to put pressure is about conservation and preservation we have to decarbonize we have to be compliant with Paris agreement this is a multi crisis with multi impacts and we have to follow up on all these STS but it's very important to remain committed on biodiversity and climate change and to be sure that we engage with all the big Powers so it's just matter of action I know that I don't believe their for ever and I will have to explain what did I do during this period of time so I don't want to be to have decayed of my life saying I'm I'm sorry I didn't know it's it's not true right we did know I just want to explain what we did cool well thank you very much for your time thank you so much by the way I'm a big fan cool thanks very much well that's cool the president is a fan but I'm still waiting for the followback on Instagram but seriously talking to him furthered my insight into the climate crisis from policy level and it's motivated me to carry these learnings back into the field and continue documenting the changes in our most remote places crucially this event is not just about world leaders it's about the scientists the key people who are gathering important data they are the ones who are pushing us forwards and finding innovative solutions for the planet what happens in Antarctica doesn't stay in Antarctica we estimate that there is a the PO potential of instability that could be a Tipping Point and with no return and so this vessel is going to be frozen into the ice drifting slowly around Pack full of scientists and some cool technology what do you hope it will achieve a common understanding of the Artic with all the nations around and of course to also to tell people and to share this adventure I mean we need we to show people with emotion and enited to do this for the next 20 years why should people that live far away from these places care because because what happens to the world's ice is what happens to the planet but we have to act now but it does require the people demanding this and not because of polar bears but because it impacts their lives I think events like these are so important because they bring together leading scientists and world leaders to come together to really figure out how we're going to fix the climate crisis and restore the health of polar regions and many world leaders have spent a lot of time talking the talk about these things now it's time for them to walk the walk well time to say goodbye to the amazing Southern right well and that's a wrap for the one Planet polar [Music] Summit"

    "content": "(soothing guitar music) - Climate change is a human story. The causes of climate change are man made and the solutions must be man made. How much of the landscape-- In order to reduce climate change, in order to adapt to these changes and to mitigate our impact on the planet, we have to start with human stories. I love listening to people's stories. I'm Victoria Herrmann. I'm a geographer and a\nNational Geographic explorer. When people read stories\nabout climate change, it's often in far off\nplaces like the Arctic or small islands, but climate change affects everyone. By the end of this century, at least 420 towns, cities and villages across the United States\nwill be partially underwater no matter how much we reduce\nour greenhouse gases today. But, there's never a narrative\nthat should be hopeless. There is hope in every\nclimate change story. It's just about finding\nthe right solutions. Over the course of 2016 and 2017, I traveled across the United\nStates and U.S. Territories and conducted over 350\ninterviews with local leaders from the Chesapeake Bay to American Samoa, from Alabama to Alaska. At first I thought the biggest challenges were going to be the loss of property, the loss of houses, of\ncritical infrastructure, but what people really\nwanted to talk to me about was losing histories, the traditions that they can pass down to the next generation. (soothing guitar music) I think of myself as first a listener and then a connector. - Oh, yes, absolutely. Like people, a lot of people that have-- - [Victoria] Most days for me are coming to places like here. We are on the Eastern shore\nof the Chesapeake Bay. Geographically we're in a\nplace called Poverty Point but the great organization\nwe're working with has renamed it Patriot Point to reflect the work\nthey're doing with this. This is an incredible property\nwhere vets come to hunt, to fish, to seek the\nhealing that they need. - These are the coats that we give out to one of the service\nmembers when they come in. - [Victoria] The owners of Patriot Point didn't realize that climate change would impact them so\nquickly and so intensely. I want to understand their history, their landscape and their\nclimate change challenges. So when you see shoreline erosion, is it usually with a big\nstorm that's coming in or is it just a king tide? - We've had a lot this year. We're having two to three\nfoot above normal tides. - [Victoria] When we\nthink of sea level rise and extreme storms, we first go to our shorelines, to the Jersey shore with Hurricane Sandy, or to Louisiana with Hurricane Katrina, but climate change impacts\nall bodies of water, whether they're bays that\ncan see sea level rise or rivers that can see flooding\ninto the plains around them. The Chesapeake Bay is one of\nthe fastest changing ecosystems in the United States\nrelated to climate change. At Patriot Point, I walked\nalong the eroding edges to see how the land has\nchanged over the past year, decade, maybe 50 years. We're looking for trees falling over, for tides rising above the marsh land, to understand the rate of erosion and how much sea levels are rising. (soothing instrumental music) To get a different perspective on that, we jumped onto a boat and\nsaw it from the water side so we can see how those waves\nare cutting under the land, and seeing how that is\nmaking this whole property more vulnerable to sea level rise. - [Older Man] Now that was\nthe tidal pond right there. - [Victoria] Oh, wow, it's all filled in. - And we're losin' a little bit there. - [Victoria] All local\npeople are valuable experts. - Here lately we've had\nthese 65, 70 mile an hour Northwest winds, Northeast winds and there's nothin' here to stop it. - [Victoria] The best\nknowledge that we get from any place is the people\nwho are living there 24/7, and the people who are\nliving through those changes. - When you got two, almost\ntwo and a half miles of water front, it's hard. - Especially when that\nwater front is changing. - Constantly. (soothing instrumental music) - [Victoria] I take everything\nthat I've listened to and analyze it, think about\nwhat potential solutions, what other expertise we can bring in to make that place safe. (soothing instrumental music) Climate change adaptations\nalong shore lines often take two different forms. Greener solutions, which use nature to make our\nlandscapes more resilient, creating salt resistant marshes, creating areas that can\nflood and bounce back, or more gray solutions, using concrete to build up a sea wall. Patriot Point can benefit\nfrom both of these. (soothing instrumental music) If you've grown up working\nand living on the water, not being able to live\non the Chesapeake Bay fundamentally changes who you are, and that's what people are afraid of. People are afraid of\nlosing their identity. - I love this area. Born and raised here, and like I say, this is what I truly love. - [Victoria] How can you leave this place? - [Older Man] That's it. - [Victoria] Each of us has expertise that we need to share so we\ncan make better solutions. We have skills based volunteers working all across the country, whether it's rebuilding\na sea wall in Alaska, helping to move a building in Louisiana, we are helping preserve local histories in the face of sea level rise. The more people we have working on a climate change solution, the better it will be. (soothing instrumental music) My grandparents were Holocaust survivors. They were survivors of\nAuschwitz concentration camp and they came to this country\nwith nothing but themselves and the memories of those who were lost and built an incredible life and gave back to their community. If they could find hope and\nresilience in that story, there's no reason why I\ncan't share that same hope and resilience in climate\nchange stories today. The future can be hopeful\nif you can work together and you can identify what every person can contribute to a\nclimate change solution. (soothing instrumental music)"

in the dirt and you're working and sweating and it's hot and it's it's hard to breathe and you're choking because of the smoke your eyes are burning and you're you're just right up against it and you look up and there are fire worlds which are like a tornado of fire literally and these fire worlds are 6 ft around and they're almost 70 ft tall they're as tall as a tree it's just a moment that you're terrified and in awe all at the same time because there's nothing there in your experience to help you to really grasp the gravity of the situation that you're in right then KN out back out get too hey back out back out back out what they are seeing is scary what they are seeing is not what they're used to at all and that's terrifying Colorado used to be considered we we called it the ASA State because it just was not a significant fire environment State and in the last 10 years that significantly changed in 2010 we had the fourmile Fire Within 2 years of the fourmile fire the record for most destructive fires was eclipsed twice and since then it's been eclipsed I think two more times 10day fires 4 day fires three day fires that was kind of the norm not two week 3 week two month all summer long we're being confronted and and asked to suppress or battle fires that didn't exist 20 years ago the hymon fire from 2002 is my opinion probably one of the best indicators of the impacts of climate change along the Front Range of Colorado here we had not seen large plume dominated fires we had what we called one day wonders when it was windy the fire would grow but when the wind stopped the the fire would basically go out hmon fire was not like that when we were on the hmon fire watching uh you know a fem run through the through the canopy and and and just knowing that that's not what's supposed to happen well there are many reasons from that it comes down to talking about drought stress trees lack of spring moisture and higher than normal temperatures and those combined created and signaled really a shift in the fire environment along the Front Range we saw fire Behavior we haven't seen before and little did we know that was the precursor to what we're seeing today and it's and it's become the new Norm respond to 71004 M Canyon Drive for trees that are caught on fire 103 I got a page letting me know there's a new fire start in Four Mile Canyon in Emerson Gulch I got the page at the same time one of my best friends Rod Maraga got the page I got a page to for the fire and uh jokingly you know said to my wife uh you know it's the big one and kind of laughed and said I'll see you in an hour something like that and I walked out the door and was like holy smokes this thing is going to go big Rod lives there had a pretty narrow view of the fire and was focused immediately on how do we put it out what I think was a Micro Burst just came down on us um probably 30 40 m an hour and that fire just fanned and and probably tripled in size within 15 minutes the conditions were extreme and I was very scared I've never been in a situation before where I've been that surrounded by fire where we were literally going house to house trying to protect property trying to save structures I at one point had a an engine that was assigned to my crew wanting to turn the assignment down I was absolutely convinced people were going to die somewhere during the day I I started thinking about my house what was ironic was that I had assigned all the fire engines and there were no more fire engines so I basically just watched until it hit my house and then I just turned around left CU I didn't really you know there was not much else to do when we see fuel loads that have increased over time when we see weather and climatology that has gone to extremes we don't have a fire season we we have a year- round Fire season and and any any month of the year is conducive to to Wildfire on October 9th in 2012 I was dispatched to a fire in Rocky Mountain National Park that right there is an outlier it's a novel event Rocky Mountain National Park does not have fires in October the risk to Firefighters was high the costs were high to suppress the fire against a less than 1% chance that the fire was actually going to do anything we decided to back off Let the Fire um kind of do its own thing for another week or two season ending event would come in and the fire would go out so nearly two months later the fire was still going and strong winds came up one night and pushed the Fire 3 miles in a night at night in practically December throughout the night we're still having active intense fire temperatures aren't cooling off as much I think that the fire environment is changing so dramatically and so dynamically because of our environment in general they're faster moving more destructive they're more volatile there are fires that have burned downhill over long stretches which kind of flies in the face of convention because fire wants to move uphill on a day-to-day basis we're being surprised and in in this business surprises what kills people from where I live in North Side Colorado Springs I got a good view right at the fire area initially I was having a hard time grasping what I was looking at we had a thermal collapse of this convective column was super heated air and gas and smoke and it had enveloped the large air of the community I was in a pickup and I started driving up these streets I was going to roll the window down and when I when I felt the radiant heat through the glass I'm that's not survivable if I take a breath of that that's not surv I need to get out of here it was chaotic I was scared to the point of being emotional VI I was convinced yeah guys would V they weren't resources really anymore to me they were you know people and so we going to tell these people you what you know tell that guy you know what you got a family don't donees matter right now you took a oath going in there we have a responsibility Community we have a responsibility to you know ourselves our profession but at what point does that no longer become viable plus I have this awareness now of what this fire Behavior has been for all these years and knowing that where does that cross over into my responsibility to go and send people to do these crazy things Jesus Christ there it is right here right here go it's okay we're out we're out when I came into that fire I thought I was ready for it because of what I'd seen but the fact of the matter is you're never really ready Black Forest made what we were seeing that first night of the Four Mile fire almost look small seeing the homes burning in these subdivisions that were already lost seeing the devastation that had happened watching the crews moving almost like they were out of their element the fire was jumping it was moving much faster than we could get in front of it it's like being in a fog Bank only it's all smoke you can't see the fire you can hear it it's out there you know it's out there somewhere but you don't see it there are lists of rules kind of Rules of Engagement as to how much fire you can put what kind of a resource on and when you're looking at that much fire you can't put any kind of a resource on it that's an oh moment so that public can't have an expectation anymore that we are going to take firefighters and put them in front of that it's beyond our capability to manage we're not going to kill good people trying to save infrastructure that we put in place that probably shouldn't be there and so that changing this new environment dry arid drought stricken area with lots of fuel is we're going to have to change the way we live in it and that's where we're struggl is there evidence of climate change in the environment you have to say yes because we are seeing a level of fire and an intensity of fire and a risk to Firefighters that that hasn't existed in the past and every indicator is every year it just gets worse this summer is my 21-year-old daughter's first year on the fire line and people always ask are your proud and in one sense yes and then in The Quiet Moments um it scares a crap out of me in my 20 years um you know I come close to dying um and you know I hope that she doesn't have that but when I look at the changing fire landscape um yeah I worry you know cuz I can't I can't tell her what she'll see because she'll see stuff that I'll never see as a society we have to take this evidence seriously we've got to start confronting climate change with the same level of effort and resources and intensity that we do to fight Wildland fires firefighters are already taking unacceptable risks [Music]"

    "content": "New Jersey is cementing its role as a leader in solar energy. The Solar Energy Industries Association reports that in the United States, New Jersey is second only to California in installed solar electric capacity. But densely populated states like New Jersey need to be creative in finding space for large arrays of solar panels. We call it solar farm. It consists of a one megawatt uh solar plant. Uh it's on a uh a brown field site. PSNG, the local electric and gas utility, is installing more than 4,000 panels on 6 acres of unused land in Hackinack. Once the site of a gas plant and then gas storage facilities, the ground was contaminated and labeled a brownfield. We've taken this site that was non-usable. It was contaminated. It's a passive use and it's going to produce power that could supply over 170 homes in the in the uh immediate area. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that nearly half a million brownfields dot the US. These former mining, industrial, or commercial properties tainted with petroleum, metals, or other pollutants become eyes, and cleaning them up for standard development is both expensive and timeintensive. The EPA has identified some 11,000 brownfields across the country as prime spots for renewable energy development. I view brownfields as a tremendous opportunity and it is an opportunity because it is located uh near population centers in in urban downtowns in rural downtowns. Since most brownfields once held power- hungry industrial, commercial, or mining machinery, they tend to have power lines and other infrastructure on site or nearby, making it cheaper to tie them into the grid. One of the real benefits of sighting a solar farm on a a brownfield site is that you you may not need to do cleanup or extensive cleanup. And the reason is that you can put these techniques where you contain the contamination uh within the the the property. Despite such savings on the land itself, solar farms are expensive. PSENG is spending about a half billion dollar to install 80 megawatts of solar generation within the year. The state's electric rateayers advocate is opposing a plan to more than double that expenditure. We think there are tremendous environmental benefits and we support renewable energy generally. The problem is that it's very expensive. So that's why you have to manage it and you also have to make sure the industry doesn't become completely dependent on rate subsidies. At some point they're going to have to learn to walk by themselves. PSEG says it has cost customers only an average of 30 cents a month to rapidly boost clean energy generation while reclaiming brownfields. and this closed New Jersey Metallands Commission landfill. This video was captured earlier in 2012. And while Hurricane Sandy in November brought major flooding and wind damage to nearby communities, officials say the solar array here suffered no significant damage. The Carne Landfill Solar Farm brings new meaning to the expression, \"One man's trash is another's treasure.\" If you look at this site here, this is our first landfill that we did. And uh in our and and it's 3 megawws. In our new filing, we've uh we want to do 90 megawatts of solar uh on landfills and brownfields. So really uh it's just another significant step in taking advantage of unused land. As the cost of solar technology comes down and utilities work to meet state goals on renewable energy, officials expect to see more brownfields become brightfields."

    "content": "( intro music ) ( applause ) Good morning. It has been a truly\nexciting week for me. It's a very empowering\nexperience for me to get to know my fellow\nemerging explorers. For me, I'm passionate\nabout energy problems. I hope we can have a sustainable energy future. Growing up in China,\nin the period that the cultural revolution\nwas in the past, China has opened up\nits doors to look for better economy\nand better lives. Our lives are getting\nbetter and better, but energy is always scarce. I remember I used\nto watch my Mom working in the kitchen\nunder very dim light trying to save electricity. About 10 years ago,\nmy parents bought a solar thermal system. Like many city people,\nthey live in apartments, those high-rise buildings. They installed a solar system on the rooftop of\ntheir building. Such a system will heat\nup their domestic water so they can have\naccess to hot water, and that makes a huge difference for their life quality. Like many families, they want to install such systems\non the rooftop and it becomes a competition. Everyone wants a space there. One day my father said, \"It will be really nice,\nwe can hang solar thermal panels\noutside our window, the piping will be\nsimpler, and everyone will have access to\nthe renewable energy.\" That makes me think\nabout there really is a strong need\nfor this kind of flexible and lightweight\nsolar systems. That motivates me\nto develop later on the solar cell stickers,\nand this work is done by my students and me\nat Stanford University. The solar stickers\nare like downside just like the stickers\nyour kids put on your clothes to say, 'Thank you, Mom,'\n'Good job, Mom.' ( laughter ) You peel them off\nand then stick it to anywhere you want,\nso that we can increase the places we can\nuse solar energy. The reason I'm interested in solar energy is very simple. There is abundant\nresources of solar energy. Here we show\nthe world's energy resources. The big one in the center is the annual energy from the sun. The ones on the right-hand side are from the finite resources. For example, the petroleum, coal, natural gas, etc. The small circles in the center represent those\nrenewable sources, their annual energy output, for example, wind,\ngeothermal, etc. The two blue dots on\nthe very left-hand side represent our annual\nconsumption of energy. The smaller one is about energy consumption in 2010. The bigger one is the estimated energy consumption\nin 2015. You can see our\nenergy consumption is increasing as we want to preserve\nour lifestyle and people from\ndeveloping countries are looking for\nbetter life quality. If we continue to\nrely on fossil fuels, we are going to\ndeplete them one day, sooner or later,\nbecause we are using them simply at a rate much faster\nthan can be regenerated. We have to rely more and more on renewable energy and solar is a\nwonderful resource. We are using solar energy now. We are using it\nin the form of solar panels. You probably all have\nseen this kind of flat panel looking thing, dark color, facing the sun. Those solar panels\nessentially is a sun-powered battery. When the sun illuminates\nthose solar panels, they will generate\nelectron holes. The flow of\nelectrons in the holes will generate current\nand that current powers the electrical load. For example, your\nphones, a lamp, etc. You can think\nabout the solar cell as a sun-powered battery\nconstantly charged by sunlight. If we look a little deeper\ninto the solar cells, a solar cell just like\na battery, as I mentioned, as all batteries you will have a positive and a negative side. The greyish color\non the top and the bottom are the positive\nand negative part. They are metallic layers. What's in between\nis semiconductor, frequently silicon,\nthat can absorb sunlight and generate electron hole that drives the current. You can think about from\nthe structure perspective, this solar cell looks\nlike a sandwich. It's the semiconductor\nsandwiched between two electrodes. If this whole thing is as thin\nas one type of solar cell called a thin film solar cell, then it has the potential to become\nflexible and lightweight. If we look at the key parameters we characterize solar cell, the one parameter\nis called efficiency. How much power can\nbe generated comparing to how much power\nis incident by sunlight? In other words, what\npercentage of sun power you can convert to electricity? For most solar cells\nin the market, it's about 10 to 20 percent. For example, if we have\n15 percent solar panels, if you have one square\ncentimeter area, you can generate\nabout 150 watts. That's enough to power\ntwo to three lamps. If I have a rock\nthe size of this rug, it will probably roughly\ngenerate about 500 watts. That's the magnitude. To increase the energy\nproduction by solar cells, one is to increase efficiency; the other to increase the area\nyou want to use it. We want to make them\nto be able to apply it\nnot only on rooftops. For example, these are\nthe rooftop solar panels at Stanford, that's over\nthe Business Center, and those are great\nfor rooftop applications. But as I mentioned,\nwe want to increase the places. There's only limited\nspace on rooftops. It will be nice\nif we can put on cars, or maybe on the side\nwalls of buildings, then those solar cells\nhave to be flexible. What's the challenge? This is how solar\ncell looks like, called the thin-film\nsolar cells. The bluish color\nis the sandwich structure, that's the solar cell that's the actual part\nthat generates electricity. Those things have\nto be manufactured on the substrate. The substrate is\nthe holder for them. The substrate\ntypically is glass or silicon wafer\nor stainless steel. The solar cell part is\nonly a couple microns, about one-tenth of the thickness of the plastic food wrap\nyou use. That's very thin, very flexible. But the substrate\nis about a millimeter scale. It's about a thousand\ntimes thicker. That's the part that\ncauses the solar cells to be heavy, to be rigid. But we need those\nsubstrates as a holder to fabricate the material. During the fabrication,\nthey put the substrate there and they deposit material\non top. It's similar as the process\nas ladies doing make-up, we have the face\nas the substrate, we put layers and\nlayers of materials and they are very thin, so they don't show up very much. The idea here is\nif we can replace the rigid substrate\nby something flexible, for example, paper or plastic, then essentially we can\nhave a flexible substrate. But we cannot directly\njust stick the paper into the solar\ncell manufacturers. They cannot sustain\nthe environment, the temperature, the chemicals. We are required to\nmanufacture solar cells. So what do we do? It's the inspiration from food. ( laughter ) It's the pizza approach. When we bake the pizza, we put this pizza\nin a ceramic pan. The ceramic pan can sustain the\nhigh temperature in your oven to cook the pizza. But when we deliver the pizza, we transfer that pizza out, put it in the paper box. That's much cheaper\nso we can have pizza at a very economical price. ( laughter ) When we look at the pizza, essentially we have two carriers for two different functions. The pan is for the\nhigh temperature\nmanufacturing process, and the paper is for\nthe delivery and\ntransportation purpose. We can do the same\nthing for solar cells. This is how we do it. This is again the two-layer\nstructure I showed you. The blue is the solar\ncell and the bottom is the thick glass\nor silicon wafers. What we do differently is we insert\na metallic layer in between, and that layer serves as a sacrificial layer later on. The solar cells will\nbe manufactured as identical procedures\nand conditions as your regular\nthin-film solar cells. What we do next\nis we soak it in water. Room temperature water,\njust the tap water, and inside water\nwe just peel it. During this peeling process, the metallic layer separates\nfrom the substrate, the glass. Now we have this thin\nsolar cell coming out, kind of like when ladies\napply the face mask. Sometimes you paint\nit and when you remove it, it comes off as entire layer. It's the same thing\nbut we have water there. Now the thin solar cells,\nas I mentioned, is only a couple microns. It's very thin\nand you can stick it like a sticker to the back\nof your cell phones. That realizes\nthe transfer process. Now we have two substrates. One for fabrication, one as the carrier\nwhen you use it. The magical part to me is really\nwhat happens in the water, and that is where\nwe have worked on. This shows the process in water. What you have\nis a four-inch wafer with the metallic layer\non silicon. My students are\njust working through the edges, trying to make sure\nthe edges are clean. You can see in the initial\none-half minute, he's just working\nthrough the edges, and then only within\na few seconds, he peeled off the entire thing. What you see in the\nfront is the silicon wafer that you can use for\nthe fabrication of solar cells. You can see, after this process, it's very clean so\nyou can use it again, just like the pans for pizza, for solar cell fabrications. The one on the back,\nthe shiny part, is the metallic layer\nand the solar cells come in behind that. Now you have\na solar cell sticker. You can stick it to anywhere. This process only requires water and is really fast. You can see this takes\nless than two minutes. We collaborated with National\nRenewable Energy Lab. They fabricated this\namorphous silicon solar cell on our modified silicon wafers. Those circles\nare the solar cells. After this peel-off process, we attached it to\nmy business card. It's very flexible. This is the initial\nsilicon wafer and it's very clean. You can use it again. The key parameter for\nsolar cell is efficiency. After this transfer process, the efficiency remains the same. That means the process\nis so gentle, it doesn't damage\nthe solar cell. That's the key. This peel technology,\nwe think can really go beyond solar cell. It really doesn't depend\non the solar cell. We are just controlling\nthe interface. If you replace the solar cells with thin-film electronics,\nfor example, display. We can have flexible\ndisplays, or batteries. We can have thin-film batteries, or sensors for human\nhealth monitoring or environmental monitoring, or any other thin-film\nelectronic devices you can imagine. It is a very powerful technique for flexible electronics. With this technique,\nI dream one day we can stick those\nsolar cells to the side wall\nof the buildings, to the shade of your windows, to your helmet,\nto the back of your phones, your iPad, to your backpack. With that, we can\npower the world, and with that,\nwe can contribute to a sustainable energy future. Thank you very much. ( applause ) ( outro music )"

    "content": "how will climate change influence our food choices in the future it's thought our food industry is responsible for 37 of our Global greenhouse gas emissions from the wavy farm and use our land to the waste we create in the process what if we could nurture nature at the same time as getting our food could something as simple as seaweed revolutionize the way we consume and actually help our planet to recover and heal regenerative ocean farming is about moving beyond sustainability it's about actually how do you farm to breathe life back into the ocean so we're growing food we're growing shellfish and seaweed but wall also capturing carbon nitrogen phosphorus the idea is to put fishermen like me to work restoring rather than depleting the oceans my name is Brett Smith and I'm the founder of Green Wave and I'm a regenerative ocean farmer and I'm based here in Long Island Sound regenerative motion farming has been happening for thousands of years in different ways I think its moment has really come the question is what is agriculture what does the sea going to look like I was born and raised in Newfoundland Canada [Music] and all I ever wanted to be was a fisherman they were my heroes so at age 14 I dropped out of school and headed out to sea and I fished the globe Cod crab herring tuna you name it I fished it and I loved it but then while I was fishing in Alaska the Cod stocks crashed in Newfoundland very real crisis in the inshore fishery The Fishery is dying it's just about dead on its feet along the entire Northeast Coast thirty thousand people laid off it was the largest layoff in Canadian history boats beached calories empty just like fishermen walking the streets as hungry ghosts that's where I realized like this is a jobs issue they're not going to be any jobs or food on a dead planet after the card stocks crashed I went into salmon farming and salmon farming was supposed to be the great solution of feeding the planet and transitioning fishermen into a new type of food production the problem was it was industrial food production out at Sea it was you know growing salmon pesticides antibiotics all this sort of stuff it just wasn't sustainable at the time so dissolution I kept searching and I ended up here in Long Island South and here there was a long tradition of shellfishing and so I remade myself as a oysterman after seven years at building my business my farm was destroyed Two Times by hurricanes Hurricane Irene Hurricane Sandy came in wiped out 90 of my crop that was my second moment working on the ocean where I realized wow like I'm a canary and a coal mine for a climate crisis that's hit a hundred years earlier than we expected if I wanted to stay at Sea and I wanted to continue growing food I really needed to figure out a new way to to start doing ocean farming our ocean covers around 70 percent of our planet but only two percent of Global Food production currently comes from our ocean grain waves Innovative approach to farming takes into account issues that have Arisen from traditional agriculture to pave the way for a healthier future it's really important we don't make the same mistakes that were made on lab I mean you look at lamb and it's about a couple companies just try to get as much food as possible from the land at any cost instead we need to go out and read life back into the ocean that's what's exciting right the farming system is really pretty simple imagine this underwater Garden from the surface you see a collection of buoys if you were to look under the waves you'd see ropes going vertically down to Anchor systems and then horizontally you just see those acre lines connected it's sort of a rope scaffolding system underwater and from there we're growing all our crops kelp seaweeds growing vertically downwards next to muscles and muscle socks you got scallops and Lantern debts oyster cages down at the bottom and then clams down at the mud the idea is just to grow as many species in the water column as possible kelp is almost ready to produce that's what we're looking for I've been farming the same patch ocean for 20 years but when I started farming seaweed especially I was just getting laughed off the docks like it was just this ridiculous thing kind of embarrassing to grow plants underwater honestly when I started it was kind of boring but over time I just grew to love it I'm actually proud of this that moment when you start the seed is just a microscopic and then four months later you come out and you lift a wall of plants out of the ocean it's a pretty stunning uh feeling [Music] four months for crops to be where they then have uses for the entire food and diet industry one of the things I did was to say kelp is the new kale you know kale was a rabbit food the famous chefs got it that they made it delicious and then it became this middle class food and kelp is just not that it's something I think way more powerful it could have a way bigger climate impact and what we've adopted is a whole Leaf strategy what part of the plant is used for artisanal products like kelp mustards and pickles and stuff the next part of the plant goes to get to the plant-based food sector products like kelp mushroom burgers and other things in that plant diet sector but then as you move down there are all these other Industries like fertilizer of biostimulates farmers would be using seaweeds as fertilizer for hundreds of years those nutrients from the oceans are so important in building healthy soil there are incredible companies that are using help for bioplastics and that's just amazing that someone like me where there's a Plastics issue in the ocean that I can actually be growing a crop that replaces Plastics with almost 8 million tons of plastic being thrown into a ocean ichio the use of seaweed as an alternative packaging is a clever solution as is the potential for its use in land-based agriculture traditional farming on land involves almost 1.5 billion cattle globally a major source of the powerful greenhouse gas methane a study found adding just one percent of seaweed to the feed cow seed can decrease myth introduction by a mighty 58 people are coming to Green Wave to get into the solutions economy and really start a sort of tackling climate change our goal is to trade 10 000 regenerative ocean farmers in the next 10 years greenwave Works in four areas one we have an online farmer trading and support program with over 3 000 people on there learning to farm together [Music] we have the kelp climate fund where we're actually subsidizing paying Farmers to plant kelp every year and in return they're using the my kelp app to collect data to track climate benefits environmental benefits on their Farms the third is Market development we're working up and down the supply chain with all different companies entrepreneurs to grow markets for kelp and to connect Growers at buyers and the last piece is infrastructure where we're out helping Farmers build hatcheries Dockside processing so that farmers own part of the supply chain to get prices for their crops we've put together the foundation to make sure that you know farmers are benefiting rather than being left behind according to the World Bank farming seaweeds in just one percent of our ocean could create 50 million jobs a mature 20 acre region rate of ocean Farm is capable of producing one hundred thousand dollars worth of products green waves model shows the potential for economic change at scale and it's not only people that are able to benefit from regenerative ocean farming nature benefits too my 20 acres was a patch of desert right it was just mud everything had died from silt running in and now it's an artificial Reef so you got seals Ducks tons of fish sea horses all this sort of stuff that come in and hang out on the farm as a fisherman turned ocean farmer my job is to shift from depleting the ocean to breed life back into our Waters a shellfish and seaweed do that an oyster for example filters 50 gallons of water a day pulling nitrogen out of the water column kelp soaks up up to 20 times more carbon than land-based plants we could grow all these restorative species that are rebuilding ocean ecosystems while putting people to work doing it and the ocean returns to its core role of balancing the climate and coming one of the main engines of mitigation if you were to take four percent of U.S Waters and farm shellfish and seaweed you could offset the entire agricultural missions of the State of California and create a protein equivalent of three trillion cheeseburgers so this is something that we could scale that we could have Major Impact that isn't just about small is beautiful but is actually could sit squarely in this set of solutions to the club crisis give people the power to be able to start their own Solutions and be part of it and really have Network production that's what the future is that Network production that hive mind where it's not about a few of us but it's actually about everybody regenerative ocean farming matters at this moment in history because as our food system gets pushed out to sea as the Water Crisis becomes more intense as hurricanes and droughts we're going to need more food from our ocean and if we could have ten thousand people out there farming doing hatcheries doing new products that's where really The Hope comes from this space where there's sort of an army of climate Warriors out there that aren't activists they're actually out there doing building and growing [Music] I was a young person again deciding what I wanted to do the climate solution space is just like a beautiful productive exciting space to be in because it's not just ocean farming the climate crisis is going to demand bundles of solutions if there's any way you could go to work every day with people to solve this crisis I think it's a you know it's a it's a life well spent foreign foreign [Music]"

    "content": "In 2018, I got to walk across the surface\nof a receding glacier in Iceland. From where I stood, I could see a patch of snow and ice\noff in the distance -- the last remnants of another glacier that had since melted away. That ice-speckled area was all that remained\nof 800 year old Okjokull, or the Ok glacier, which was officially declared dead in 2014\nby Icelandic geologist Oddur Sigurðsson. It once spanned an area as large as 38 square\nkilometers.  In 2019, the loss of Okjokull was commemorated\nwith a plaque on the site of the former glacier. It’s the first monument dedicated to a glacier\nlost to human-induced global warming. Looking after our planet and all its dynamic\necosystems and landscapes -- including glaciers -- is everyone’s job. We know rising temperatures\nare correlated with rising carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and the amount of carbon\ndioxide generated by our day to day actions can have an effect on the other side of the\nworld.  But while individual actions matter, who is\nemitting carbon dioxide is highly unequal. About half of total US emissions in 2019 were\ndirect emissions from corporations, coming from sources like power plants and oil and\ngas production facilities. So they also have responsibility to share the burden.  Knowing who or what is emitting carbon dioxide\nis only part of understanding climate change. We also study who emissions affect and the\ngeographical impacts of a warming planet. Climates are complex, so I don’t have all\nthe answers, but there's a lot we can learn. I’m Alizé Carrère, and this is Crash Course\nGeography. INTRO Even with a problem as complicated as climate\nchange, we can start with a picture. Like this picture of Muir Glacier in Alaska from\n2004. Pictures and maps can show us where land masses,\noceans, and geographical features are located, which is spatial information that we kinda\ntake for granted.  The Earth is dynamic, and we have to remember\nthat both pictures and maps are really snapshots of a particular time. So if we compared this\nimage to past ones of the same area, we’d see how it’s changed and we could explore\nwhy change is happening here.  A photo taken in 1941 from the exact same\nspot as the recent photo shows an entirely different landscape. The glacier was much\nbigger. After looking at lots of old and new photographs, current glaciological surveys,\nand the geologic record, we know glaciers around the world, in places like Alaska, the\nSwiss Alps, and Mount Kilimanjaro, have shrunk dramatically. Muir Glacier is just one example.  To get deeper into the \"why,\" we know that\nice and snow melt faster as air temperatures get warmer. But glaciers also depend on how\nmuch precipitation they get each year -- if less snow accumulates, glaciers lose more\nice on their bottom edge than they can replace at the top. That precipitation comes from\nthe hydrosphere, and its regional patterns can depend on temperature and wind patterns\nover distant oceans. So mountain landscapes have changed as climate\npatterns have changed, which ties back to the global energy budget and insolation and\nthe beginning of the Earth. It’s a complicated problem.  The terms “climate change” and “global\nwarming”  are often used interchangeably. But even though these phenomena are closely\nrelated, there is a difference between them.    Climate change is the change in average weather\npatterns in a region over a long period of time. These changes can be natural or anthropogenic,\nmeaning human induced.  And when I say long, I mean each climate period\ncan last for several decades or longer. For example, there was a Little Ice Age that happened\nfrom 1300 to 1850 CE. Mountain glaciers expanded worldwide and mean annual temperatures dropped\nby 0.6 degrees Celsius in the Northern Hemisphere. That’s a five hundred and fifty year climate\npattern, which then changed to a different one.  On the other hand, global warming is the increase\nin the average surface temperature of our planet. In our current period of global warming,\nthere’s been a well-documented rise of average temperatures around the globe since the Industrial\nRevolution in the 17 and 1800s.  So when scientists or leaders talk about “global\nwarming”, they’re almost exclusively referring to this recent warming, which comes from human\nactivities that increase greenhouse gases emissions, like carbon dioxide, methane and\nnitrous oxide. They trap solar energy, so more heat is held in the atmosphere.   That additional energy is changing not only\nthe average temperature, but also climate processes within the atmosphere and oceans.\nThese include more extreme storms, heat waves, droughts, changing regional temperature and\nprecipitation patterns that cause vegetation zones to shift, and glaciers to melt -- which\nresults in sea level rise and changing coastlines. Essentially, when the planet gets warmer,\nclimates change.  We know the Earth has had many different climates\nthanks to paleoclimatologists, who study past climates through proxy data, or data that\nprovide clues about the past.  Comparing multiple proxies gives us a more\ncomplete picture of what happened and helps us anticipate the changes we need to prepare\nfor. For example, they use tree rings that show\ndry and wet years, fossilized bugs that tell us about moisture and temperature levels of\nbygone ecosystems, or deep-sea sedimentary records that reveal the ocean's past. Like, the deep-sea sedimentary record shows\nthat the Earth overall had one of two extreme climates and glaciers advanced and retreated\nacross the Earth at least 28 times during the past 2.6 million years.  We can see that when glaciers advance and\nthe climate is colder, glaciation occurs and sea levels drop. And when the climate is warmer,\nglaciers retreat, and sea levels rise, ushering in an interglacial period. Which is what we’re\nin right now. One of the most useful kinds of proxy data\nfor atmospheric conditions and how climates changed year to year are ice core data. From\nice, we can extract the chemical composition of past atmospheres. Using special drills,\npaleoclimatologists have extracted long tubes of ice from ice sheets and alpine glaciers\nall over the world, and estimated climates going back at least 400,000 years. Let’s\ngo to the Thought Bubble. On the top is fresh snow that fell this year and\nthe year before and the year before that. Underneath is the snow that fell when Marco Polo travelled\nthe Silk Road and beneath that when the Buddha gained enlightenment.  And the deepest layers were laid down long\nbefore recorded history.  The very bottom of ice sheets in places like\nGreenland and Antarctica have snow that fell before the beginning of the last ice age,\n115,000 years ago or more.  Just like snow on a sidewalk can get compressed\nby boots into sheets of slippery ice, the snow on ice sheets is compacted into huge\nsolid masses.  And buried in each layer of ice is evidence\nof past atmospheric conditions: tiny air bubbles, which act like time capsules.  Once an ice core is moved from the field to\nthe lab, scientists use isotope dating to tell whether the carbon dioxide in those frozen\nbubbles was released from burning materials like wood or coal in the lithosphere, or\nif it was airborne during a nuclear explosion, or if it was part of the natural cycling of carbon.  Paleoclimatologists have collected polar ice\ncore samples and analyzed historical air bubbles from Greenland and Antarctica, tropical glaciers\nin the mountains of the Andes and Kenya, and mid-latitude glaciers in the Alps and Himalayas.  When all these data are lined up, scientists\ncan compare them with each other and see atmospheric trends, which in turn shows climate change\nover thousands of years.  Analysis shows that it can take just a few\ndecades to change from colder to warmer climate patterns.  That might not sound fast, but when you’re\na 4.5 billion year old planet like the Earth, that’s nothing.  Thanks, Thought Bubble. By analyzing proxy\ndata like bubbles in ice cores, we know the Earth's climate has changed significantly\nmany times. As geographers, let's go deeper into why these drastic changes happen.   Based on that proxy data, paleoclimatologists\nhypothesize that climates change because of any combination of several driving forces.   First, past climates could’ve changed because\nof orbital causes -- like changes in the shape of the Earth’s orbit, its tilt on its axis,\nand the time of year when the Sun is closest to the Earth. Like calculations by the mathematician\nMilutin Milankovitch show that lots of glacial cycles occur every million years. Second, volcanic activity can release enormous\namounts of volcanic dust into the stratosphere. Strong winds spread that dust around the world,\ndarken the skies, and reduce the amount of insolation that can reach the surface, which\nlowers temperatures.  This is related to the albedo effect, or the\namount of sunlight a surface reflects back into space. Volcanic dust and even the color\nof surfaces change Earth’s albedo. White surfaces, like ice, reflect the Sun’s energy,\ncreating a cooling effect. So when there’s less ice, the opposite happens -- darker surfaces absorb sunlight and warm the surface of the Earth.  Similarly, when something big like an asteroid\nstrikes, it can cause an “impact winter”. Like volcanic activity, a big impact throws\ndust and debris into the air, blocking out insolation and lowering temperatures. Such\nan impact may have caused the extinction of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago. Another reason that climates change is when\ncontinents and oceans get rearranged. Like when the Isthmus of Panama formed, it broke\nthe connection between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans which re-directed ocean circulation\nand created the Gulf Stream. This changed how moisture and ocean currents moved around\nthe globe, which as we know contributes to climate patterns.\n  And finally, climates change when greenhouse\ngases in the atmosphere change. We know from ice core data that carbon dioxide levels in\nthe atmosphere decreased when glaciers formed during ice ages and increased during interglacial\nperiods.   However, what’s happening now is unlike\nanything in the past.  We're in an interglacial period now, and glaciers\nare melting faster than ever before in the geologic record. Average annual global temperatures\nhave risen between 0.3 degrees C and 0.6 degrees C and sea level has risen between 10 and 25\ncm during the past 100 years. And in 2016, global atmospheric carbon dioxide\nlevels passed the 400 parts per million mark, which is higher than at any time in the past\nmillion years. More carbon dioxide increases the amount of heat trapped in the lower atmosphere,\nenhancing the natural greenhouse effect that makes life possible. So our climates are entering\nnew patterns.   If this upward trend in global temperatures\nwas caused by natural processes alone, geographers would consider it natural climate change.\nBut, like I said, what's happening now is unlike anything we've ever seen on Earth.  So scientists have used multiple lines of\nevidence like tree ring and ice core data, glacial retreat and sea level rise, isotope\ndating, changes in atmosphere, and changes in weather phenomena to study the climate.\nAnd they’ve concluded that there is a greater than 95% probability that human activities\n-- like burning fossil fuels, industrialization, modern agriculture, and deforestation -- have\ncaused most of the Earth’s warming since the mid-20th century. We are experiencing\nanthropogenic global warming.  But not all areas will be affected equally\nby global warming and modern climate change. While materially rich countries are the main\nproducers of greenhouse gas emissions, materially poorer countries will bear most of the impacts\n-- like becoming climate refugees, people being forced to flee their homes for safer\nplaces. Thousands of low-lying islands and coastal\ncities face a threat of rising sea levels by the end of the  21st century, when sea\nlevels are predicted to have risen 26 to 77 centimeters. That’s pretty significant considering\nover half of the world’s people live within 100 kilometers of a coastline. For example, located halfway between Australia\nand Hawaii, Kiribati has 33 atolls that sit less than 2 meters above sea level, and average\nonly a few hundred meters wide. The government of Kiribati is planning a 2-phase “migration\nwith dignity” and has purchased several thousand acres of land in Fiji, as a potential\nresettlement location for its 102,000 residents.  But \"migration with dignity\" isn't an option\nfor all countries and communities. For some places, adaptation is the only option, like\nbuilding sea walls or raising streets and homes. And for some that will mean moving\nto higher elevations after the flooding without government support for the process. Flooding from sea level rise is just one of\nmany changes that we can anticipate. Other places, for example, will experience drier\nconditions with the potential for droughts, heat waves, and wildfires. The current ways\nthe Earth's climate is changing because of global warming will affect all of us as individuals,\nso it's our collective responsibility to pay attention and take action.  Here’s the thing about human-induced climate\nchange: knowing that we humans are the main cause means it’s also in our power to try\nand stop it! We still have a small window of time to work together and aggressively\nreduce our emissions to save communities around the world from disaster. To do that, our individual choices can make\na difference, but we also have to hold corporations and governments responsible for the policies\nand large-scale emissions that affect our atmosphere and climate. This will ensure safer,\nhealthier, and more biodiverse futures for the next generations who inherit our planet. I know the problem of global warming may sound\noverwhelming -- you’re not alone. But from decades of science, we know what the problem\nis and what the solutions are. It’s now just about finding ways to successfully integrate\nthem into society. In future episodes, we’ll continue to examine\nhow geography can help us work on the problems that pop up where climate change intersects\nwith society. This has been the focus of my research for the last several years and even\nthough it’s an urgent area of work, it’s also incredibly motivating and exciting to\nbe a part of finding the solutions. Many maps and borders represent modern geopolitical\ndivisions that have often been decided without the consultation, permission, or recognition\nof the land's original inhabitants. Many geographical place names also don't reflect the Indigenous\nor Aboriginal peoples languages. So we at Crash Course want to acknowledge these peoples’\ntraditional and ongoing relationship with that land and all the physical and human geographical\nelements of it. We encourage you to learn about the history\nof the place you call home through resources like native-land.ca and by engaging with your\nlocal Indigenous and Aboriginal nations through the websites and resources they provide. Thanks for watching this episode of Crash\nCourse Geography which is filmed at the Team Sandoval Pierce Studio and was made with the\nhelp of all these nice people.

    "content": "our planet has been draped in ice sheets filled with boiling hot oceans and dimmed by volcanic ash all before anything more complicated than a single-celled organism showed up so climate change is nothing new around here when it happens gradually over millions of years but something new has happened in the last few centuries People Like Us except wearing hats like this began burning fossil fuels like coal oil and natural gas to make energy most of us aren't wearing hats like those anymore but we're still powering our daily lives and industries with those fuels releasing billions of tons of carbon dioxide every year and that's caused earth's climate to change in the span of just a few human lifetimes the geological blink of an eye hi I'm Dr Sammy your friendly neighborhood entomologist and this is Crash Course biology hey do you guys smell that smells like same music [Music] now I know what you're thinking wait is isn't this crash course biology and yeah this episode is heavy on the gases low on the Golgi bodies and that might leave you wondering what does climate change have to do with the signs of Life here's the thing life and climate are tied together like that Tangled pair of headphones at the bottom of your backpack you know like you you tug one end and then a knot tightens which is looked around a paper clip somehow snagged on that tiny notebook where he drew Hearts around your crush's name which after several drugs is now lying open on the floor and I'm breaking a new cool switch thinking about it um but back to the point we can't talk about life without talking about climate which doesn't mean last week's thunderstorm or or a one-day temperature swing that's weather climate is long-term weather conditions averaged over many years to understand the difference between them just remember that knowing the weather will help you decide if you should grab an umbrella before you head out but knowing the climate will help you decide if you should invest in a good air conditioner while the weather might impact your choice of clothing for the day the climate directly impacts wear and when different kinds of Life can survive we owe today's climate to the fact that our little green and blue marble of a home isn't just floating in space unprotected it's wrapped up in an atmosphere a big invisible gassy jacket which granted sounds pretty weird when you put it that way but without it we wouldn't exist this jacket is made of different kinds of gases and a small fraction of them known as greenhouse gases absorb solar energy like super well we're talking about gases like methane water vapor and most importantly carbon dioxide also known as CO2 they account for less than half of one percent of our atmospheric jacket but they're a part of what makes it so good at trapping heat sort of like all the little white feathers in your puffy coat when sunlight beams down from space most of it travels through those gases with no problem the energy from that sunlight gets absorbed as it strikes the Earth warming the surface that type of warming is normal and seasonal the Earth naturally bounces some of that solar energy back towards space where some of it exits the atmosphere and heads right back out into the inky ether but the rest of that energy gets trapped by the Earth's gassy jacket specifically by those super absorbent greenhouse gases which suck up heat and bounce it back down to us again this warming process is called the greenhouse effect unsurprisingly it works the same way as a greenhouse using layers of glass to trap heat inside and it keeps Earth at a nice cozy insulated average of 14 degrees Celsius without it our Earth would be a chilly average temperature of negative 18 degrees Celsius great for storing ice cream the rainforests swimsuits or us for that matter so the greenhouse effect is a natural healthful process that makes Earth habitable for all of life but you can have too much of a good thing when our atmospheric jacket contains more carbon dioxide for example it gets really good at trapping heat like too good and the hotter things get the more water evaporates and joins the atmosphere and remember water vapor itself is a greenhouse gas so that in turn absorbs even more heat creating a looping system of cause and effect that just keeps reinforcing itself and while dressing in layers is great if you're hiking in the Alps it's really hard for our planet to shed its extra coats so all of that heat gets stuck going from the ground to the atmosphere like the worst game of hot potato ever played when I learned about this I was like wow what a revelation I can't believe we've only recently figured this out but it turns out that this isn't new knowledge we've known how and why this could happen for nearly 170 years let's pay a visit to the theater of life back in 1856 Eunice foot an American scientist and suffragette was thinking about how the sun's warmth affected different gases in those days the scientific Community was a bit like a fort with a handmade no girls allowed sign out front but foot wasn't deterred and ran her experiments anyway she filled tubes with different combinations of gases including carbon dioxide after putting some tubes in the Sun and some in the shade she compared their temperatures trying to find the hottest gas all the tubes in direct sunlight warmed up but none as intensely as the tube that contained carbon dioxide the temperature had soared to 51.7 degrees Celsius hot enough to burn your fingers from that Insight foot theorized that if our atmosphere ever contained more carbon dioxide the whole planet would warm up as a result which would mean a lot more than a few slided fingers and sure enough today that's exactly the situation we're in foot was one of the first scientists to recognize carbon dioxide's potential to affect earth's climate but she wasn't the only one to connect the dots for example just a few decades later another scientist named Dr cevante arenius observes that burning coal releases carbon dioxide as a fossil fuel coal forms from the decomposed carbon-based bodies of plants and animals that lived and died a long time ago and I'm talking before the dinosaurs so no I'm afraid that means you aren't gassing up your car with the remains of a T-Rex when we burn those fossil fuels whether it's in the form of coal oil or natural gas carbon dioxide gets released into the atmosphere when Arenas ran the numbers he predicted that carbon dioxide released by burning fossil fuels could warm our climate within a few thousand years if we kept burning them at their current rate but we far outpaced his estimates our emissions of carbon dioxide have grown and grown and grown and so has the mountain of evidence that those emissions are warming our planet some oil and gas companies have worked to promote uncertainty around the existence of climate change and what's causing it while they have only very recently acknowledged its existence as of 2023 they're still trying to deflect from what's causing it but the scientific consensus on this is overwhelming you can learn much more about that in our climate and energy series we've only been reliably taking direct measurements of Earth's Global temperature since the 19th century but at measly slice of Time Shows a steady rise in temperature of a about 1.1 degrees Celsius since 1880 and we know that that's unusual because we've learned to read Earth's much longer climate diary in the form of ice cores see when snow hardens into ice Tiny Bubbles of air remain trapped in the gaps between snowflakes these gases and water molecules stay frozen like entries in a frosty Journal so by drilling deep down into Polar Ice we can snoop on what the atmosphere was like hundreds of thousands of years ago ice cores show us that carbon dioxide levels have fluctuated over the past 800 000 years and and temperatures have fallen and risen alongside them too but when people started burning fossil fuels carbon dioxide levels began to spike quickly like really really quickly and they haven't stopped Rising before the Industrial Revolution for every million molecules of air in our atmosphere around 280 were carbon dioxide molecules but by 2022 the number had increased to 422 the highest concentration of carbon dioxide our planet is seen in 4 million years and that's surge in carbon dioxide affects more than just the temperature as the amount of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere Rises it impacts all of Earth's systems like yanking on the end of that Tangled mess of headphones impacted all of the other items in my bag and eventually everybody around us when stuff started falling out it's all connected is what I'm saying for example the ocean is our planet's largest carbon sink it's sort of like a big storage container for carbon in fact the ocean holds 50 times more carbon than the air or soil do but a chemical reaction happens when carbon dioxide meets water it creates an acid so that influx of carbon has already turned the ocean 30 percent more acidic since the 19th century as carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases trap more heat there's more energy pouring into our planet than going out that means more energy is pumped into the ocean fueling hurricanes and and typhoons to become more frequent and more intense as the whole planet gets hotter that triggers all kinds of changes spring arrives earlier leading to Shorter Winters and longer summers Rising temperatures lead to double whammy droughts and heat waves and that leaves Forest floors full of dried up plants that serve as fuel for wildfires to ignite spreading faster farther and more often plus Earth's polar ice caps are melting transforming solid ice to slush and sea water and that's causing ocean levels to rise and encroach on land so while some communities are already facing a problem of not enough water others are facing a problem of too much and because these adverse changes layer on top of existing social inequalities they disproportionately affect lower income communities and people of color making climate change not only a scientific issue but a matter of environmental justice that has spurred some researchers to political action for example climate scientist Nicole Hernandez Hammer witnessed firsthand through her field research the sea level rise alongside Miami Beach's Latino communities but these communities were not included in conversations about climate change or the dangers of rising sea levels so hammer took action moving into environmental Outreach and education and while the threat is still there these communities are now in conversation about climate change and able to plan and advocate for the future of their environment and the good news more broadly is we know exactly why these Tangled complex effects are happening the more we burn those fossil fuels the more greenhouse gases we release and that's driving sweeping changes all over our planet and these changes are impacting life at all levels from the tiniest bacterium to the elephants of Botswana to you and me we can slow these impacts by breaking up with fossil fuels but we also have to invest in Nature's carbon sinks such as soils and forests Which pull carbon out of the atmosphere and back into the land where it can't keep heating things up it won't be the easiest breakup we've designed whole societies and Global Systems around fossil fuels we should fully expect to be listening to Jasmine Sullivan on repeat with a gallon of rocky road but this is one relationship we can't afford to stay in so in order to hold emissions we have to both invent new systems and work more efficiently within old ones and to do that we've got to get a whole planet's worth of people on board and if you've ever been part of a group project you know that last part isn't easy thankfully when faced with global crises humans have one great thing going for us we are creative I mean we've been to space we've we've got electric cars we made Furbies for some reason and so yes it's going to take all of our creativity and cooperation to tackle but the only way through in the only way through is together in our next episode we'll tune back into the world of living things and see how our rapidly changing climate involves much more than the atmosphere it affects every living breathing organism on this planet including you and me this series was produced in collaboration with hhmi biointeractive if you're an

    "content": "climate change is intimate and personal at this point it affects you every time you go to the grocery store or fill your gas tank or Vote or flush the toilet or put on your long underwear for a later than usual snowfall and every year it will affect you more at the same time it's cosmically impersonal it involves gases and rocks and chemicals that have been operating in relationship for billions of years before there are any persons or underwear to contend with at all in between these two levels the sphere of your bedroom and the sheer vastness of the history of the universe there are still other Vantage points to look at climate change from climate change is a collective and a systemic problem dealing not just with individuals but with entire populations and Global Systems like energy grids and international trade so we have to kind of zoom in and zoom out travel through time and space and as centuries of mad scientists have taught us it's not an easy task hi hi I'm M Jackson and this is Crash Course climate and energy [Music] think about it there's the human lifetime where we all live where there's weather and politics and hard choices and Beautiful Moments of collaboration and then there's hundreds of years that contain full human lifetimes the generations yet to come that will be impacted by the climate-related choices of today and yesterday on top of that there's the multi-billion year timeline of Earth which is entirely alien to our human perception but we won the planetary Lottery with our habitable Earth the only one out of the thousands of planets known in our galaxy were life like ours can survive so yes truly understanding climate change across all these timelines is tough sometimes it's downright mind-blowing but it's on us to Grapple with what's happening not just to the Earth but to all of its inhabitants as the climate changes faster now than ever before and I mean that the earth's climate has never changed this fast let's start the human scale a single human actually a human named Eunice foot in the 1850s she was reading an issue of Scientific American and became curious and like any good scientist she nerded out about how the sun heats up the Earth she wanted to see how density and the mixture of gases in the air affected how much heat the atmosphere could hold on to and she tested that with a series of experiments in one of them she noticed that high concentrations of so-called carbonic acid gas made the air heat up faster and stay warmer for longer based on her experiments she concluded that if the atmosphere ever contained more of this gas then we might also expect the global temperature to be higher today we know carbonic acid gas as carbon dioxide so foot became one of the first scientists to make the link between carbon dioxide and Atmospheric heating it was one of the first experiments demonstrating the greenhouse effect you know that wash of warm air you get when you go into a greenhouse it happens because glass panels do a great job of trapping the sun's heat to nurture your tomato plants well imagine scaling that up to the entire Earth but instead of glass trapping heat it's gas gas specifically gases like carbon dioxide methane and water vapor which are known collectively as greenhouse gases you can think of the greenhouse effect like a giant volleyball game between the Sun and the surface of the Earth where the atmosphere is the net and instead of one ball there are trillions the sun serves these balls as different forms of radiation what you and I might experience is visible light UV light or infrared radiation which is just another fancy way to say heat some of that radiation makes it over the metaphorical neck it passes to the atmosphere and hits the planet's surface a lot of that energy is then absorbed by the land and the sea he worked by bulgo the land and sea naturally reflect back some of their heat energy but with the greenhouse effect more and more heat energy is getting trapped by the gnat then the energy gets absorbed by the atmosphere instead of escaping into space the other side of the court that causes the energy to bounce back down towards the surface of the Earth warming it up the Earth is losing the cosmic volleyball game returning fewer and fewer of the sun serves every year as the amount of greenhouse gases goes up now instead of having a constant number of balls on our side of the Court we have more each day although greenhouse gases only make up a small portion of the atmosphere they play a major role in controlling our planet's overall temperature and its climate even increasing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by just a few parts per million can lead to temperature changes that fuel severe weather melt ice caps and make life on Earth generally more difficult how do we know this by studying the chemistry of rocks and fossils that are hundreds of millions of years old scientists can piece together how ancient temperatures fluctuated and how in parallel the composition of our atmosphere fluctuated but if we want a more recent picture we can get an even better record from drum roll glaciers ice cores from Greenland and Antarctic ice caps have preserved Tiny Bubbles of our actual atmosphere from hundreds of thousands of years ago that today scientists like me can study what all these records tell us is that throughout Earth four and a half billion birthdays at times it's been a lot colder than today and at other times it's been a lot warmer and guess what is one of the most consistent variables that leads to that temperature fluctuation you got it the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere so let's travel through time and space to see what things look like when those bubbles were in their Prime let's go to the thought bubble back when earth was formed about four and a half billion years ago it was hot and I don't mean eating your body weight and popsicles hot I mean covered in an ocean of molten rock hot Earth was still being pummeled by debris from the formation of the solar system and volcanoes were spewing out a whole lot of carbon dioxide helping to trap all that heat over millions and millions of years the molten rock solidified forming a solid surface on the earth and millions and millions of years after that the Primitive ocean formed as a result the Earth continued to gradually cool down and then a couple of times throughout its early history before animals we'd recognize today even evolved things got really cold so cold that researchers think ice sheets and sea ice extended all the way to the equator these are called snowball Earth periods and scientists have a few ideas about why they happened ranging from volcanic ash blocking out the sun to a drop in carbon levels which was possibly a result of things like early plants sucking in the gas for photosynthesis after that it got hot again a few times over the next half a billion years most recently about 56 million years ago back then average global temperatures were as high as 23 degrees Celsius there would have been no ice at the poles and palm trees and crocodiles could be found at the Arctic if humans had been around we'd probably have been building tropical water parks at the North Pole because if there's a one thing we know for certain about our species so we love a twisty slide but maybe thankfully for everyone modern humans wouldn't evolve for over 55 million years we know our fragile civilizations water parks at all wouldn't have stood a chance for these dramatic shifts in Earth's climate thanks thought bubble now luckily for the human species the ice core record of the last eight hundred thousand years reveals much gentler temperature fluctuations at least until we get to the last 200 years in just a couple of centuries temperatures have gone up faster than ever seen before in recorded history and the average temperature on Earth today is the highest it's been in a hundred thousand years we've never experienced this before even when Earth emerged from previous ice ages the planet warmed up at a rate of only about one degree Celsius per 1000 years but today global temperatures have shot up by 0.7 degrees Celsius per 100 years that's almost 10 times faster so it changed in the last 200 years well there was one big thing the Industrial Revolution when humans discovered we could do things a lot faster and with a lot less effort by burning fossil fuels fossil fuels like coal oil and gas provided a reliable source of heat and electricity so when we went for them in a big way they helped to shape our modern civilization and that's how you ended up here watching this video on an internet largely powered by fossil fuels but burning these fuels comes at a cost it releases carbon dioxide and as we've burned more of them to keep up with our growing population and our energy needs our emissions have gone up as well and that volleyball match keeps getting harder to watch so this is what we know the average global temperature has gone up and carbon dioxide emissions have gone up and we know that carbon dioxide is a heat trapping greenhouse gas as scientists have put those things together it's LED them to an inescapable conclusion human activity has caused the Earth to warm up at an unprecedented rate we can measure this warming with every passing month but its Global effects aren't as straightforward there's a big difference between what scientists study as climate and what you and I experiences weather weather is where we live so when you wake up in Istanbul and March and see that it's weirdly cold and also snowing that's weather and although it may seem at odds with a warming Planet it's happening as a result of climate shifts Elsewhere on Earth climate deals with multi-decade broad-scale Trends in things like temperature and precipitation patterns across the globe but since climate and weather are so closely linked it can get complicated for instance scientists agree that atypical extreme weather events are more likely when the planet's climate is warmer but that's only because there's more heat trapped in the oceans and atmosphere to power these weather events meteorologists are constantly working to improve their forecasting models for both short-term weather and long-term climate based on how much energy is in the atmosphere by comparing and refining their models scientists can now reliably predict some general outcomes if the current pace of climate change continues and it might come as no surprise that it's not looking good we can expect and are currently already seen in some cases melting ice caps rising sea levels shifts in agricultural productivity more storms more floods more droughts basically climate change amplifies any weather you might typically experience and these effects can ultimately lead to global economic losses displacement of vulnerable communities and almost inevitably geopolitical tensions changing climate and changing weather patterns will have a significant impact on everyone all over the globe but not everyone will experience the same consequences of those impacts or be able to adapt to them in the same way and those who have been and may continue to face some of the most severe consequences are often in Region's least responsible for the greenhouse gas emissions driving global climate change so the question becomes what do we owe each other as roommates on this singularly lucky planet where we live alongside tomato plants and vibrant blue glaciers and frill neck lizards and blobfishes and incredible human creativity we know temperatures have fluctuated dramatically over Earth's long history but by burning so many fossil fuels and flooding the atmosphere with gases like carbon dioxide we also know we're causing temperatures to rise faster than ever and while this is a massive challenge that won't have easy solutions there are lots of fascinating ideas for how humans might tackle climate change from a number of different directions we don't know all the answers and we can never return to the Earth of 250 years ago but we'll explore the many cobblestones that might make a pathway forward towards a new way of living together on our Earth even if it's a bit

    "content": "climate scientists agree that we need to seriously reduce our greenhouse gas emissions if we're going to avoid the worst impacts of climate change and one of the best ways to do that is to ditch fossil fuels as our main source of energy the good news many countries have already set targets to become carbon neutral by 2050 and much of the technology to do that already exists to use an American football analogy we have the ball now we just have to run it to the end zone the difficulty is fossil fuels are so embedded in our lives that the path to a Greener future is full of economic political and Social Challenges like tons of opposing players trying to stop us in our tracks so if we want to make it through we're going to have to strap on our helmets and Tackle those obstacles head on hi hi I'm M Jackson and this is Crash Course climate and energy [Music] fossil fuels are a huge part of our lives for three main reasons one they pack a lot of energy into a small space for instance a liter of gasoline contains about as much energy as three to four sticks of dynamite and unlike a handful of dynamite the energy and gasoline can be released gradually rather than all at once in a big explosion that makes it an ideal fuel source for engines generators power plants equipment that needs to run consistently the second reason fossil fuels are everywhere they're versatile sure they can be used to heat your school keep the lights on or power a cargo ship but they can also be used in less obvious ways like to make fertilizer to provide heat to make cement and steel or even to make synthetic fabrics and plastic as a society we've really taken that versatility and run with it incorporating fossil fuels into virtually every industry ultimately though the thing that makes fossil fuels so useful which is the third uniting Factor here is that there are cheap fossil fuels are cheap partly because they've been widely available in abundant underground and because we've built a lot of infrastructure around them but they're also cheap because for the last two centuries governments have put a huge amount of effort and action into making them cheap often that takes the form of subsidies which are kind of like coupons direct subsidies are incentives offered to fossil fuel producers and consumers to drive the prices down at the production end this can take the form of tax breaks offered to oil companies and cheaper and more flexible leases for companies that want to mine or drill on federal lands on the consumption side of things some governments find ways to cut prices for consumers like you and me for example until 2015 the United Arab Emirates effectively made a nationwide discount on gas so when their citizens fueled up their gas was cheaper than market value in a time when it's in our best interests to move away from fossil fuels it may be surprising that these subsidies are still alive and well across the world but not too surprising we all have a hard time saying no to a discount and when those discounts involve the raw materials that drive the economy and for now much of our daily lives saying no is even harder than turning down a buy one get one free coupon on science t-shirts even when you already have a closet full of them like I do between 2017 and 2019 the International Energy agency estimated that together the countries that hold most of the fossil fuel supplies gave more than 550 billion dollars of direct subsidies each year but direct subsidies aren't the only way that the price of fossil fuels is kept low imagine you spent a hundred dollars on your bike but whenever you wrote it you smash through your neighbor's Gardens causing them to have to buy new plants and spend money and time printing don't bike in my garden signs if you add up all the money your neighbors had to spend suddenly your bike is costing a lot more than a hundred dollars it's just not costing you that extra money this is what is called a negative externality it describes costs that are passed on to someone other than the producer or the consumer in other words they're externalized when fossil fuels are burned whether to fuel the tractor produce building materials or power a city it has serious impacts on human health and the environment for instance the air pollution around fossil fuel power plants results in higher rates of asthma cancer and heart disease for the people who live nearby treating the affected people costs money that wouldn't have to be spent if the power plants weren't there in the first place in the U.S alone the health care costs related to fossil fuel generated energy are estimated to be up to 886 billion dollars per year on a broader scale the greenhouse gases emitted when we burn fossil fuels are also causing the planet to get warmer ice to melt and sea levels to rise as a result more homes are being damaged by floods and Storm surges and land and water supplies are damaged by intruding Salt Water by some estimates rising sea levels are expected to cost the world 14 trillion dollars a year by 2100 because fossil fuel companies aren't held accountable for this type of impact some Scholars consider these costs to be indirect subsidies and when you combine the indirect subsidies with the direct ones the fossil fuel industry receives from governments the overall cost of subsidies goes through the roof so why are governments still working so hard to support fossil fuels well for at least the last two centuries energy usage and economic growth have gone hand in hand as countries develop their economies they have a stronger need for Reliable energy and electricity and the more energy they can get the wealthier they typically become and everyone wants to be rich right keeping these fuels cheap has consistently boosted country's economies and for the most part improved standards of living locally that doesn't mean things have to be this way if countries transition to other ways of getting energy like solar or hydroelectric power they could help their economies and their people without all the baggage that comes with fossil fuels but the key word here is transition if governments ditched fossil fuel subsidies all at once the price of things like gas would Skyrocket right now without Alternatives many people would stop being able to pay their bills or fill their tanks and if a country suddenly had to go cold turkey on fossil fuels without other ways to get energy history has shown us that that doesn't go well here comes the thought bubble during the Cold War Cuba was a strategic Ally for the Soviet Union and the Soviet government provided a lot of trade and economic support in return for their allegiance but after the Soviet Union fell in 1991 Cuba's economy was left high and dry this led to a time of Crisis for Cuba known as the special period practically overnight the country was cut off from up to 80 percent of its International Trade including critically its energy supplies from there the effects rippled out to practically every corner of daily life without reliable electricity long blackouts became common leaving the population without electric fans to defend against the tropical heat and cutting power to refrigerators petroleum Imports fell by 50 percent and without cars or buses Cubans had to walk or cycle everywhere without the fossil fuels to power them domestic industry and aggregate culture effectively ground to a halt Cupid wasn't making enough food or other products to sell to other countries they weren't even making enough to sustain their own country in the Years following the fall of the Soviet Union food was rationed and Cubans consumed a third fewer calories than was typical hunger and malnutrition became the norm with people losing an average of more than 5 kilograms each it was a dark time for Cuba that lasted more than a decade resulting largely from the sudden loss of their fossil fuels and these challenges only lessened with another country Venezuela begin trading with Cuba for oil in 2000 thanks slot bubble one takeaway from Cuba's special period is that relying on imported fossil fuels for energy makes a country vulnerable to what's going on in the rest of the world and that's still true today for instance Russia has historically been the largest exporter of oil in the world and its natural gas fuels most of Europe so when Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022 and Russia's fossil fuel exports dropped oil and natural gas prices around the globe Rose to their highest levels in a decade to try and protect themselves and their people from scenarios like what happened in Cuba and in Ukraine many governments keep discounting their own domestic fossil fuel supply so energy stays cheap and they aren't as vulnerable to International conflict unfortunately though not every decision in favor of fossil fuels is based on a government's concern for its people political parties often receive funding from the fossil fuel industry which puts pressure on them to act in ways that benefit those corporations and the rabbit hole goes even deeper than that some fuel corporations like Exxon Mobil shell and British Petroleum have participated in and even coordinated around misinformation campaigns these corporations conducted their own internal research as early as the 1970s and 80s and independently verified the link between fossil fuels and climate change Exxon Mobil even concluded way back in 1982 that fossil fuel use would need to be reduced in order to minimize catastrophic and irreversible climate change but for a business that only makes money when Humanity uses fossil fuels This research was terrible news the writing was on the wall to protect the planet and everyone on it companies like Exxon Mobil would have to lose a lot of cash and that wouldn't go over well with the board or shareholders so ExxonMobil decided to do something about it but instead of addressing the problem they worked to sow seeds of doubt about the true causes and impacts of climate change their overall message was that sure the climate is changing but it's not that bad and we can't really be sure humans are responsible right in other words they put out a message of uncertainty a memo leaked from a meeting of the American petroleum Institute in 1998 stated that quote informing students and teachers about uncertainties in climate science will begin to erect a barrier against further efforts to impose kyoto-like measures in the future those Kyoto measures they're referring to that's the reduction in emissions that International organizations were trying to enact at the time so it's clear that the American petroleum Institute was trying to stop the world from moving away from fossil fuels and even decades later the industry is still doing what it can to stop further regulation for instance oil and gas companies have created misleading materials that were sent to students and teachers which aim to undermine what the global scientific Community has learned about climate change and the fossil fuel industry has also directly funded scientists to publish articles or speak to the media about unverified and intentionally misleading research in opposition to the United Nations climate conclusions thankfully many individuals and groups are working hard to fight all kinds of misinformation all the time in a way you're gearing up to fight the good fight right now by watching this series of Crash Course and getting curious about the different chapters in this big climate story fossil fuels are embedded in nearly everything we do from our drive to the specialty mac and cheese store to our noodle cooking to the production of the shirt we spilled cheese on and I could keep going for hours on just cheese related connections the good news we're not stuck in the status quo government-funded agencies and international groups are working harder than ever to bridge the gap between their research and public views on climate change with more widespread awareness comes more calls to action which can result in changing government policy investment in research and technology for climate Solutions and clear paths forward what do those paths look like we'll talk possibilities in the next episode Special thanks to Les

unchecked that's going to make our planet a lot harder to live on climate change has brought and will continue to bring extreme environmental events that will be hard to prepare for experience and recover from with effects that will continue to layer Upon Our world's existing inequalities but there are things we can do each of us can do to help protect our planet ourselves and each other we can't change the past but together we can change the future and slow down and stop climate change in meaningful ways hi hi I'm M Jackson and this is the final episode of Crash Course climate and energy [Music] in 2015 countries around the world Forge the historic Paris agreement in it they committed to taking decisive action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and keep climate change in check for many countries that action became a pledge a pledge to reach Net Zero carbon emissions by 2050. that means they've agreed to reduce emissions by as much as possible and make up for whatever they can't eliminate by removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere the goal of these pledges is to limit how much the average global temperature goes up specifically to limit warming by the end of the century to less than two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial Revolution levels and ideally to stop at 1.5 degrees that half a degree might not sound like much but science has shown that it makes a world of difference for instance in parts of southern Europe Central America and Australia which are already suffering occasional water shortages two degrees of warming would create intense and long-lasting droughts but when warming is kept to 1.5 degrees the situation is a lot less severe with some places experiencing half as many water shortages as in the worst case scenario and that's just one example everything from the vegetables you eat to the coral reefs you want to visit someday would have a better chance at survival with just 1.5 degrees of warming ultimately it translates to better food security and higher quality of life for millions of people and for all life here on planet Earth that said staying under 1.5 degrees of warming will be really really tough as a society we're super invested in burning fossil fuels for energy to the point where even an industry that seems unrelated on the surface like textile production releases roughly a billion tons of greenhouse gases every year so if we're going to keep our warming planet in check we're going to need to overhaul our ways of doing just about everything and soon as of the time we're posting this in 2023 we're on track for temperature rises between between two and three degrees Celsius unless we make a big and Rapid change so limiting ourselves to 1.5 degrees is nothing short of a Monumental challenge still if we take immediate steps to transform every major industry it is possible to get to Net Zero carbon emissions by 2050 and in so doing keep warming in check a policy making organization called The International Energy agency has even given us a road map full of possible milestones it involves things like stopping the sale of fossil fuel boilers to heat our water and homes by 2025 and stopping the sale of gasoline-powered cars by 2035. by 2040 the whole world would be running on electricity with net zero emissions and half of all buildings would have systems in place to operate without releasing greenhouse gases by 2045 we would be getting half of our heat from efficient low carbon heat pumps and finally by 2050 even manufacturing would be transformed with more than 90 percent of heavy industry like Machinery production and shipbuilding being considered low emission manufacturing processes are often especially hard to decarbonize so in addition to technological breakthroughs on the materials we use we would likely also rely on Technologies to capture the emissions released rather than letting them Escape in the atmosphere so say you're 15 years old watching this in 2023 if we stuck to a plan like this then by your 42nd birthday party you'd be living in a very different world imagine it there'd be no more coalfield power plants belching smoke over cities the phrase gas guzzler would also be a thing of the past because there'd be no more gasoline pumps instead you'd be rocking an electric hot rod Camry or hopping on public transit powered by carbon free electricity and in your home that same electricity would power all your devices from your phone charger to your robot Butler Greetings oh hey John greenbot thanks the incredible thing is this future it's not some sci-fi pipe dream well maybe you are John greenbot we've learned throughout this series that there are many carbon neutral technologies that exist right now in every sector they just need to be made affordable to take off but to make this Net Zero future a reality we'll also need some serious technological advances for example we already have options for generating carbon neutral electricity wind solar nuclear hydroelectricity and more but to use them to power the whole world we'll need big improvements in electricity storage and transmission so we can get power whenever we need it and wherever we need it and Technology won't be the only hurdle to overcome there are still a bunch of government policies subsidies and initiatives in effect that are designed to keep fossil fuels cheap they make various carbon-free options artificially expensive by comparison creating something called a green premium but if governments can thoughtfully reduce and eventually eliminate fossil fuel subsidies they can help make carbon-free energy more affordable and make technologies that emit greenhouse gases look less appealing the money governments are currently spending to make fossil fuels cheap could also be used to make carbon neutral energy cheaper or to research new emissions-free technologies ultimately though when it comes to getting to Net Zero every emission sector and every area of the world will need a different approach there's no one-size-fits-all strategy meanwhile the stakes keep getting higher so if you're feeling like all of this is overwhelming you're not alone government subsidies emerging Technologies many of the solutions to climate change might seem like they're happening on a level way above your head and the things you can do like Walker cycle make thoughtful purchasing decisions eat less meat vote all of these are awesome by the way but they can feel discouraging or maybe small it's hard to beat just one person trying to make a difference especially when you consider the impacts of what you can do versus the impacts of major corporations from 1965 to 2017 just 20 companies were responsible for a whopping 35 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions globally so where do people like you and me fit into that part of the story well companies governments and research centers developing new technologies they all have one thing in common they're made by people supported by people and can be changed by people and in a lot of big ways young people are leading this charge you've probably heard of Greta tunberg a Swedish environmental activist who has led School strikes and spoken at Global Climate conferences and while she might be the most famous she's far from the only young person to stand up for the climate at 18 years old Rwandan student Joseline irocose noticed piles of electronics thrown away in a local landfill so he invented an app that helps people figure out where they can recycle them locally at 12 years old emrati Canadian student kakashabasu started a company to get young people involved in local sustainability efforts and today she leads people in planting mangrove trees in Tidal habitats that have suffered deforestation at 16 years old Delaney Reynolds founded a program in Florida to educate youth in her community about the dangers of sea level rise and that's just to name a few examples of young people entrepreneurs Educators and activists have inspired people of all ages all over the globe to take action against climate change getting involved in climate change doesn't only mean making speeches staging strikes or going to marches whether you're into storytelling or gardening engineering or educating there's something there for all of us because whatever you're into and whatever you're up to climate change intersects with it way back in the first episode of the series we learned how climate change normally happens over centuries and Millennia throughout Earth's long history it's been a drawn out process driven by things like volcanoes and splitting continents but now driven by burning fossil fuels and greenhouse gases climate change is happening over decades over individual human lifetimes since climate is all about long-term patterns and things like rainfall and temperature climate change can be hard to point to it's everywhere all around us all the time and once you learn how the climate is changing and what's fueling it you can start to connect the dots see how it intersects with everything in your life climate change is the storm made more powerful by a warmer ocean the wiped out the lettuce crops a made your favorite salad more expensive it's the apartment complex being built down the street from cement and steel made by burning fossil fuels it's the late season snowfall that knocked out your power the fumes from a diesel-powered tractor and the lack of accessible public transportation in your town on the flip side climate change is also the electric pickup truck your neighbor just bought and the solar panels sparkling on those new apartment roofs and the falling cost of batteries and activists pitching their governments on policies that make heat pumps more affordable it's people and organizations coming together to try and slow the damage that's already been done to the climate and prevent things from getting worse so Engineers storytellers artists Farmers business owners students you name it we're all a part of the story of Earth's changing climate and once you learn what to look for you can see how climate change weaves throughout your entire life when you hear stories about people fighting against climate change it can sometimes sound like it's just one person standing up on their own facing down a whole government but almost always change happens because a group of people often from different backgrounds and walks of life team up for something they care about and there's a lot of people to team up with surveys have shown that the majority of people on Earth are concerned about climate change and are willing to do something about it at the end of the day it human creativity can put a plane in the sky an unthinkable magic trick at the time then human creativity like yours and mine can when joined together see us out of this mess I like to think of it like this we have 8 billion people on this planet that's eight billion people coming up with eight billion possible solutions forward climate change is everywhere and so too are the ways to solve and stop it this involves talking to community members designing new technologies passing new laws protecting natural spaces and caring for people and Landscapes most affected by our shifting world and of course there's a lot of learning involved too so hey thanks for being here for this series ultimately reducing emissions by 2050 will take a huge effort on the part of scientists governments corporations and individuals especially individuals banding together other as groups and communities sometimes that effort just looks like talking to each other about climate change helping one another see how it impacts Our Lives who we are our futures this can be enough to tip the first Domino to start a Cascade of hope that changes this generation the next one and all the ones to come special thanks to Claire Golding this episode's robot

    "content": "At this point people have been studying the impacts that humans have had on the world around us for a solid 50 years. And while it's hard to get a handle on exactly how the choices we make every day affect the environment, there's no question that our lifestyles, our\ncars, our need for more farmland, and our love of all kinds of plastic stuff are putting the hurt on ecosystems all over the world. Human activity all by itself,\njust people doing what they do, could be responsible for the extinction of\nnearly 1000 plant and animal species to date— most of them over the last century. And even if you don't particularly care about the Barbary lion, or the St. Helena olive, or the passenger pigeon, or anything else we've driven into extinction,\nthe thing is: we need these other organisms. The ecosystems of the world are working very\nhard for us every day, filtering water, sucking carbon dioxide out\nof the air, producing all the food we eat... All very important ecosystem services, benefits\nthat the natural world provides us for free. So having ecosystems and keeping them intact is important not only for the organisms who live in them, but also for us, the animals who rely on them for thousands and thousands of things that we could never do for ourselves. Over the next two episodes we're going to\nlook at these systems and how our actions are affecting the ecosystems\nthat we need for our survival. Basically we're messing up the environment\nsix ways from Sunday, but to make it easy on ourselves, let's start\nwith the top five. [Theme Music] We often hear about all the different ways\nthat our behavior is affecting the biosphere: extinctions, climate change, deforestation,\nacid rain, desertification, pollution and more! But you're asking, \"Why are all those things\nbad? What is going on? How is this stuff turning the Earth into sausage?\nI don't understand.\" Well, I do understand which is why I'm qualified\nto make this video, so let me lay it on you. The services that ecosystems provide for us, all the dirty work they do, can be broken up into 4 different categories. They're things that we could never, ever,\never duplicate or work around, no matter what kind of smarty-pants technology\nwe come up with. First, healthy ecosystems provide support\nservices that create and replenish the foundation of the earth's biological systems. These services include recycling all of the\ncompounds that are necessary for life, through the carbon, water, nitrogen and phosphorous\ncycles. They also include other processes we've talked\nabout before, like forming new soils and producing atmospheric\noxygen. Some ecosystems contribute more to these services\nthan others, but none of them can get these basic jobs\ndone unless they are intact. Two: Ecosystems also perform provisioning services, giving us the raw materials we need to live. Like, the ocean provides food in the form\nof fish sticks and stuff. And rivers and aquifers and other freshwater\nsources give us water. Plants and animals also yield all kinds of\nfiber that we use for clothing and shelter. And all around us we find sources of fuel, whether it's biomass in the form of grasses or wood, hydropower in the form of flowing water, or the carbon locked in millions-of-years-old trees that we're now re-releasing into the atmosphere. But I'm getting ahead of myself. Ecosystems also perform super-important regulating\nservices, moderating many of the earth's systems that\ncan get dangerous if they get out of whack. Like as we learned in Biology: fungi and other organisms take on the task of decomposing dead things and poop. Meanwhile, plants help filter the water you drink and the air you breathe, and provide flood control. And they also absorb all that carbon you exhale\nand that your car belches out, which in turn, helps regulate the climate. And finally, number four, ecosystems are just\nkind of awesome. It's nice to be surrounded by happy plants\nand critters, doing their business. Nice, robust ecosystems give us places to play, scenes to inspire us, and things to just discover and learn about. These are their less tangible, but still important\ncultural services. An interesting thing about ecosystem services\nis that economists actually can, and do, calculate the monetary value they\nprovide for humanity. If, for example, we had to do all of the things\nthat ecosystems do for us, it would cost us $46 trillion/year. Which is a lot, considering that the output\nof the global economy is $66 trillion/year. So, yeah, we should be happy that we don't\nhave to pay for all that. But you'll notice that I keep saying that ecosystems can only serve up all this awesome sauce if they are \"intact.\" By that I mean they specifically have to have\ntheir biodiversity intact, because ecosystems are just a bunch of living\nand nonliving things working together, so unless their living parts are healthy,\nthey're basically just rocks and weather. The main reason biodiversity is\nso important is that it makes ecosystems more resilient to that never-ending change we talked about a few weeks ago. Ecosystems with high biodiversity are way more resilient to disturbances than those with low biodiversity. In a high-biodiversity system, if you take one species out of the mix, it's less likely that the ecosystem will collapse. Take a hectare of Amazonian rainforest: in that little patch of land, there are more different species of plants and animals than there are in all of Europe. So if a species of insect goes extinct, there's less risk that the whole house of cards will fall than, say, in the Sonoran Desert, where there are very\nfew organisms, so the disappearance of one species could\naffect the entire ecosystem. So the best way to understand our impacts on the environment is through how we affect biodiversity. Unfortunately, it turns out that we've been\ndoing a really bang-up job of endangering some of the highest biodiversity\necosystems on the planet. In some cases, we're having impacts on the\norganisms themselves directly. In other cases, we're affecting biodiversity\nindirectly, by creating one or two changes in that ecosystem that cascade into all kinds\nof problems for living things. First, let's look at that hectare of Amazonian\nrainforest again, because even though it's one of those super-resilient ecosystems, we're having serious impacts on it. How? Well, first by removing a lot of what\nmakes a forest a forest: trees. According to some estimates, we're clear-cutting\naround 8,000 hectares of trees a day to provide land to graze cattle on, and to\nharvest wood to make coffee tables or whatever. When you cut down a hectare of rainforest, suddenly a place where a few thousand species used to live turns into a place where just a handful of species live: some grass, some weeds, maybe some rats or\nmice, some insects and, you know, some cows. Because man, we love cows. And when you take out so many of the living things on that hectare of land, a bunch of things happen. For starters, you're not just affecting that\necosystem, but neighboring ecosystems as well. For instance, all those trees that were cut\ndown provided the service of regulating the flow of all that rain that rainforests get, not only by absorbing some of it but also by slowing down runoff, letting the water seep into the soil, before slowly making its way into streams\nand rivers and ultimately the ocean. But when those trees are gone, the water hits\nthe land and shoots off in the nearest stream, causing erosion and washing minerals and chemicals all the way to the sea, where it affects marine ecosystems. And when I say \"affect,\" I don't mean in a\ngood way. This, my friends, is what's called a cascade\neffect, in this case caused by deforestation, one of the most obvious, observable human\nimpacts. In addition to causing more flooding and changes\nin water quality, deforestation on a large scale can lead to\nanother impact: desertification, or the spread of dry, unproductive\nlandscapes. But cutting down trees doesn't automatically\nturn a forest into a desert, desertification is driven along by additional\nfactors, like overgrazing by cattle, and over-irrigation. So how can over-watering something make it\nturn into a desert? Well, when we use groundwater to irrigate crops, the natural salts in the groundwater build up in the soil, eventually making it so salty that nothing\nwants to live there. Over time, fertile land near desert ecosystems\nbecomes overtaxed, and the desert spreads. And this is exactly what has happened in China\nover the past century, where overgrazing and the cities' unquenchable\nthirst for water have caused the Gobi Desert to grow by 3,600 square kilometers\nevery year. Now, these two impacts by themselves clearly\nlimit the biodiversity of otherwise lush ecosystems. But because they also result in fewer trees\nthat provide the all-important services of releasing oxygen and absorbing CO2, you know\nwhat domino's gonna fall next: the climate. Carbon dioxide: the principle greenhouse gas.\nIt insulates the Earth. So it stands to reason that the more CO2 there is in the atmosphere, the warmer the earth will be. And the thing is, we're reducing the size\nof forests at the same time as we're unleashing all kinds of greenhouse gases\nby burning fossil fuels. This double-whammy is much of what's driving\nglobal warming. As a result, we're seeing decreases in the\nlevels of polar sea ice, which means less habitat for polar bears,\nseals and sea birds. More temperate animals are moving closer to\nthe poles, and hotter, drier conditions are causing more\ngrass fires and forest fires. And while the climate has changed many times\nin the past, those changes usually took place over centuries or even millennia, giving organisms time to adapt or move. These changes are taking place within our lifetimes and it's kind of a huge deal, and it's complicated. It'd take me at least, like, 10 minutes and\n52 seconds to explain it all in detail. Which is why I did that in another video. By now hopefully you can see how one human\nimpact can lead to another, and how, even indirectly, they can end up\nreducing biodiversity. But it's hard to overlook the more immediate\nimpacts we can have on ecosystems. One of the more in-your-face ways we affect\nbiodiversity is by introducing nonnative species, either intentionally or unintentionally. Again, there are so many examples of this that you can learn more about it in another video I did. But suffice it to say: whether it's kudzu\nin North America, or cane toads in Australia, invasive species have a knack for out-competing\nor outright eating native species to the point that it rocks the world of an\nentire ecosystem. And finally, probably the most direct impact we have on biodiversity is simply overharvesting certain organisms. We're overfishing the oceans to meet growing\ndemand for popular fish species, like tuna, while on land we're exterminating important predators, like wolves, to protect livestock...those cows again. And the less diverse those ecosystems are,\nthe more vulnerable they become to disturbances, including those other four impacts I just\nmentioned. And the fact is, there's a bunch more where\nthose came from because there's a whole separate set of effects\nthat humanity has on the biosphere that stems simply from us putting the wrong amounts of certain stuff in the wrong place at the wrong time. That's what we call pollution, so tune in\nnext time when we'll explore what it really is, where exactly it's coming from, and what we\ncan do about it.

    "content": "many of us have grown up with the knowledge that the threat of climate change is looming but it's not some far-off danger anymore climate change has already shown up at our doors busted into our living rooms and is now on our couch eating our mac and cheese it's happening it's been happening it will keep happening no matter how many polite hints we drop and even if we throw everything we've got at decarbonizing our lifestyles this unwanted guest isn't going to see itself out right away takes time for our changes to kick in and real talk we can't fully undo the damage that has already been done but it's not time to hand over the keys and surrender there are ways to slow and solve this before it reaches a number of worst case scenarios but we will have to deal with the current effects of climate change along the way hi hi I'm M Jackson and this is Crash Course climate and energy [Music] so far average global temperatures have already risen a full degree celsius since before the Industrial Revolution about 260 years ago one degree dramatic pause all right I get it that might sound a bit melodramatic all that lead up for just one degree share one degree outside doesn't change whether you're wearing sweatpants or shorts to go jogging but when the entire planet warms by one degree on average that's a lot of energy added to the system a lot of change also this is an average global temperature which means some places have warmed less than one degree While others have warmed more for example the average temperature in the Pacific Northwest of the United States has risen about 0.7 degrees Celsius meanwhile in the Arctic the average temperature has gone up by about three degrees depending on where you live you might have already noticed some changes the weird warm days in Winter or the heat waves that won't quit in the summer but local warming can have effects Way Beyond you wearing shorts on your ski trip to Alberta for example in Spring 2022 India and Pakistan experienced a record-breaking heat wave with temperatures in India consistently three to eight degrees Celsius above average add in a lack of rainfall and this led to failed crops and at least 90 fatalities and scientists believe an event like this was 30 times more likely as a result of climate change similarly the 2021 Dixie fire in California was among the largest and most destructive in the state's history it swept through more than 3 800 square kilometers of land and damaged or destroyed more than 1400 buildings the fire itself was started by a power line which isn't climate change's fault but before that came two years of below average rainfall and drought which were exacerbated by climate change meanwhile places that aren't being baked are being flooded as glaciers and ice sheets melt the average global sea level is already risen by around 20 centimeters in the last 150 years 20 centimeters doesn't sound super dangerous on its own kiddie pools are deeper than that but this has already been enough to drown a number of low line in Solomon Islands in the South Pacific and in the U.S high tide flooding is happening up to 11 times more often around the Gulf Coast than it was in 2000 the United Nations Refugee agency estimates that on average more than 20 million people are displaced every year by sudden extreme weather events like flooding fire and storms now when extreme storms happen it's hard to point a finger and say that single weather event was for sure caused by climate change instead what we can say is hey that storm the one we all just hit under our desks from that storm was accelerated made worse by climate change what's happening is this all that extra heat that's become trapped in the atmosphere has increased the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events basically climate change has taken your local weather and fueled it up making whatever weather you're experiencing bigger bigger droughts bigger rain events bigger cold snaps bigger everything all this from the average global temperature going up just one degree Celsius unfortunately climate and weather scientists have been predicting how conditions are going to keep changing in the coming years and decades and they found that one extra degree probably won't be our stopping point one of the most powerful tools scientists have for making predictions like this are climate models basically they take an area of Interest like a country or the entire globe and split it into thousands of three-dimensional grid cells that represent the Land Ocean and atmosphere then they apply equations based on the laws of physics to those cells to represent how energy and matter like heat and water transfer between them so if you have an extra hot cell near the equator the math will describe how that heat will dissipate into the surrounding cells up into the higher latitudes then researchers run millions of calculations and in the end the models show how these cells or different regions will change and interact over time to check how accurate these models are scientists do something known as hind casting where they run simulations into the past and compare the results against historical measurements if predictions for the past are found accurate it's likely future predictions will be too after being tested and refined over and over again these climate models don't have the most cheerful news for us various models forecasted if we keep emitting greenhouse gases at the rate we've been going the average global temperature will increase by 2 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial Levels by 2100 and because of the way heat is moved around by wind and waves some places will end up even hotter in the Persian Gulf where it can already reach 40 degrees Celsius in the summer scientists predict that temperatures will get even higher becoming flat out and tolerable to the tens of millions of people who live there people literally wouldn't survive outside in the heat the models also forecast melting Tundra ecosystems sea level rise disrupted ocean and Atmospheric circulation and more frequent and intense weather disasters and because of the tricky interconnection of weather across the globe we can also expect extreme cold weather events to become more common or blizzards more cold snaps more ice storms and as time goes on each of these changes will have Ripple effects if the planet warms by 2 degrees Celsius by 2100 average sea surface temperatures are expected to rise by a similar amount for as nice as warm water feels when you're swimming at the beach warmer oceans make it tough for some organisms to survive and while some animals can just try to swim somewhere else tropical coral reefs can't move to escape the heat so they're predicted to die in huge numbers scientists think that more than 99 of them could be gone by the end of the century this also means the fish and other animals that call Reeves home will die and we would have massive but preventable loss in biodiversity on our hands which isn't troubled just for the oceans it's also trouble for the many low-income Coastal communities in places like Kenya and the Seychelles that rely on Coral habitats for food and income so if they disappear these communities will be at risk of becoming more impoverished where will they get their food and this is just one example of the Ripple effects caused by a warming climate you push over one Domino and the impacts are felt way down the line unfortunately it doesn't take a big leap of imagination to see how economic and humanitarian impacts can add up and how they'll change millions of lives around the world experts estimate that the global GDP that's the total value of the goods and services made by everyone on Earth will actually be lower in 2050 than it is today even though the population is growing and becoming more developed it's thought that Global productivity will drop by more than 10 percent thanks to everything from lower crop yields to the loss of infrastructure due to rising sea levels and once that Domino Falls so do the standards of living for many people often worsening pre-existing inequities it's a expected that in South Asia alone which is an area particularly vulnerable to climate change up to 800 million people will experience a significant drop in their standard of living as higher temperatures affect everything from agriculture to how diseases spread these effects could leave some people unable to afford nutritious food and others with serious illnesses like malaria in areas that didn't used to be susceptible to such diseases similarly if we keep heading towards a two degree warmer World by 2100 sea levels are expected to rise by as much as one meter and because of this it's expected that around 630 million people worldwide will have to decide whether or not to leave their house communities state or even country as their homes are drowned or otherwise affected by high tide flooding this will be a decision that people will have to make on an individual and family basis choice between fleeing towards an uncertain future elsewhere or trying to stay and weather the storm like we've mentioned before these effects won't be felt equally everywhere either lower income communities and parts of the world are expected to be the most affected by a warming Planet underscoring the inequity these areas are often the least responsible for carbon emissions and their systems are the least equipped to deal with the heat sea level rise or extreme weather events AKA everything those emissions bring with them and it gets Messier still you see the Earth and individual climate systems are connected so changes to one effect and exacerbate the other and vice versa this causes what's known as a feedback loop for example as global temperatures increase they're melting ice and permafrost in the Arctic and as the ice disappears it's releasing huge amounts of the greenhouse gas methane that's been underground for if all that methane gets out it'll mean even faster warming catastrophic ice melt and even more methane escaping basically if the methane gets out more methane gets out a feedback loop scientists estimate there's twice as much carbon currently locked away in permafrost as there already is in the atmosphere so the more we release the faster we Zoom towards two degrees and Beyond now all of this is well it's it's a tough pill to swallow but it's not too late to put some breaks on this climate train some of these effects will be unavoidable but it doesn't have to be full steam ahead to that two degree warmer world climate scientists have evidence that if we pull the emergency brake and take major steps to reduce emissions we could limit warming to just 1.5 degrees Celsius and that half a degree matters a lot it could help us avoid many of the worst effects of climate change Seas wouldn't warm as much saving some Coral Reeds and the communities that rely on them dry areas would have fewer issues with water scarcity and heat waves would be shorter and less deadly and the push for carbon neutral Solutions will help in many other ways like with climate change itself cleaning up our act also has Ripple effects in countries without reliable access to electricity the introduction of Equitable renewable energy like solar and wind power would help improve health care education and job opportunities at low-carbon sources of electricity for power and transport also tend to emit fewer pollutants so would help improve air quality in growing urban areas too it's the most beautiful satisfying chain of falling dominoes ever and who knows what Solutions future Generations will bring so there's strong evidence that the planet will continue to warm but if you shake your magic eight ball and ask it exactly what the future holds it's probably going to say something like it's up to us and we all have a role to play it's pretty wise stuff from a magic eight ball reducing greenhouse gas emissions now will help us reduce some of the worst impacts in the future which is literally life-saving work for you for me for future Us in climate action is an all or nothing either it's going to be a big task to reach carbon neutrality by 2050. but even if we don't make it all the way we can still keep working to limit how much the temperature rises every half a degree matters and every little bit we can do will improve things for future Generations and for all of us here now special

    "content": "Hi. I'm John Green. This is Crash Course World History and today we're going to talk about climate change. Mr. Green, Mr. Green, that's not history;\nthat's science, and also, I don't think that's even happening. Yeah, two things, Me From the Past: One, uh, contemporary climate change is real. Uh, two, this isn't the first time the world has experienced disruptive climate change, believe it or not. [Theme Music] So, climate change, of course, can be a very controversial topic, at least here in the US, but we're not discussing today whether contemporary climate change is caused by human activity, although it is. We're talking about history, and history is never controversial. We know that climate change can happen because it has happened. In fact, although we're living in an age of global warming today, for most of the early modern period, the globe experienced cool temperatures. Some historians have called this the Little Ice Age, which would make a great animated movie. Someone should get on that. Anyway, good job, historians, giving something an evocative name for once. I'm picturing a tiny little ice ball, like a snow globe. Apparently, the Earth was regular-sized back then, but anyway, the Little Ice Age lasted from the thirteenth through the nineteenth centuries and it was a period when average temperatures were cooler than they are now. This doesn't mean that it was always cold, though; there were volatile shifts between bitterly cold winters and wet summers and long droughts. Also, weather conditions were not always the same in all parts of the world, kind of like how the winter of 2014 was terribly cold in the United States but still one of the warmest on record worldwide. Climate is not weather. So, we know temperatures were colder partly because of science but also because of history. Science has shown through the study of stuff like tree rings and ice cores that it really was colder back then. But we also know this from history. I mean, records kept at the time by monks, and wine-makers, and others\nalso reported cold weather and bad harvests. Bad harvests are crucial to our understanding of the Little Ice Age because they were catastrophic events, bringing hunger and, in some cases,\nstarvation to millions of people. And because they were so catastrophic, people wrote about them, which leaves us a historical record. Less food meant more disease and also more crime. Poor harvests often led to civil unrest, especially bread riots. For some, a sensible strategy was to hit the road or, in the case of the Norseman, hit the sea. In fact, sometime during this period, their search for better fishing grounds led them to America. And humans also prove very innovative when adapting to new climate extremes. One example near to my heart is the Netherlands, where people developed water control systems and experimented with new agricultural technology\nto make farms less vulnerable to terrible weather events like floods. But the Little Ice Age led to unpredictable\nharvests around the world and without, like, Spam to fall back on, a couple bad harvests in a row was fatal. So, the whole Little Ice Age was pretty bad but the seventeenth century was the worst. Some historians even refer to it as a period of global crisis. I mean, here are just a few examples of the political instability in the seventeenth century: the English revolutions of 1640 and 1689, Spain's European Wars and debt problems, peasant and urban worker uprisings in Italy, the fall of the Ming and the rise of the Qing Dynasties in China, a succession crisis in the Ottoman Empire, wars between colonists and Native Americans that nearly destroyed Britain's colonies, the Mughal Wars of Succession, oh, and the Thirty Years War. And that's not even to mention Shakespeare. No Little Ice Age, no Shakespeare. That's what I would argue. Totally a climate-dependent writer. I would be just as good as him if only we were in a period of climate change. Now, obviously, we can't say that all of these upheavals were caused by cooler temperatures, but they did correlate with them, and in many cases, weather contributed to them. Unrest was often linked to food shortages and taxes.The taxes were high and the food was short because the harvests were bad. Now, for many people in the seventeenth century, the cause of the calamitous bad weather was obvious: human sinfulness. As Welsh historian James Howell wrote in 1647, \"God Almighty has a quarrel lately with all mankind, and given the reins to the ill spirit to compass the whole Earth.\" Others blamed bad weather on witches, always a safe bet, or on natural phenomena like eclipses, earthquakes, comets, or sunspots. And they might not have been totally wrong. Well, they were totally wrong about the witches, but- but there were fewer recorded sunspots, especially in 1617 and 1618, when the Thirty Years War began. Oh, and there were twelve volcanic eruptions between 1638 and 1644, which produced dust veils that might have made the whole planet cooler. The weather in the middle of the seventeenth century, right around the time of the English Revolution, was especially bad, like in Massachusetts, 1642 was so cold that the bay froze, while in Indonesia, the droughts caused rice harvests to fail. Much of Africa faced droughts between 1640 and 1644 and in 1643, flooding in the Low Countries was so bad that cows and chickens ended up in trees. And Scandinavia recorded its coldest winter ever in 1641. And these changes in weather were profoundly disruptive because much more than today, people depended directly on agriculture, and thus the weather, for their livelihoods. Let's go to the Thought Bubble. So, according to historian Thomas C. Smith, \"Farming, with its allied tasks, was the principal occupation and nearly the sole source of income for most families, and its rhythms defined the annual cycle of work, rest and worship. Severe annual variations in the harvest reverberated through family life...\" According to Geoffrey Parker, a fall of two degrees Celsius during the growing season, precisely the scale of global cooling in the 1640s, reduces rice harvest yields by between thirty and fifty\npercent. \"In latitudes north of the temperate zone,' each fall of 0.5 degrees Celsius in mean summer temperature decreases the number of days on which crops ripen by 10 percent, doubles the risk of a single harvest failure, and increases the risk of a double failure six fold.\" Harvest failures led to food shortages which led to everything from stunting via malnutrition to rising food prices. A 30 percent reduction in the grain harvest often doubled the price of bread, whereas a fifty percent reduction quintupled it. And when people have\nto spend more on food, they don't have money to spend on other stuff, which means the people who make that other stuff are suddenly unemployed and hungry. And then, hunger itself reduced the amount of available food by diminishing people's capacity to work, since a decrease from 2,500 to 2,000 calories halves our ability to work efficiently because the body's basic\nmetabolism still requires 1,500 calories. And hungry people are also more susceptible to disease. Add together floods, droughts, harvest failures, and disease, and you get a vicious cycle leading to population decline, which is exactly what happened in the seventeenth century. Thanks, Thought Bubble. So, all of that is pretty horrible, but human suffering in the seventeenth century wasn't just caused by cold and drought. There was also a lot of war going on. And these wars between and within states multiplied the effects of hunger as soldiers looted wherever they went. Like the Chinese even coined a word for soldiers' bad behavior: binghuo, which means \"soldier calamity\". And then, to add injury to injury, the costs of most of these wars were borne by the peasants, who suffered doubly as their taxes went to pay for the king's wars, which brought soldier calamity. These taxes were often on staples like bread, and so they often led to bread riots, which were not great for morale. And yes, terrible weather could even contribute to the fall of dynasties. The 1641 drought in China was so bad that the Grand Canal began to dry up for the only time in history, which reduced rice shipments to China's capitol. Unable to feed the people, the Ming emperor surrendered to the Qing in 1644. Drought and cold had also encouraged the Qing to overthrow the Ming in the first place as poor harvests in Manchuria convinced their leaders that invading China was the only way to avoid catastrophe. And then the Qing got to China and they were like, \"Where's all your food?\" and they were like, \"Yeah, the whole planet is colder, not just Korea.\" But then they were already there\nso they decided to have a dynasty for a while. I am your history teacher. So, obviously, protests and rebellions were public responses to the hunger and war, but many people confronted the problem of hunger by trying to reduce the number of mouths they had to feed. They could do this by reducing\nthe number of births through postponed marriage or, in more extreme cases, through infanticide. And the most desperate resorted to suicide. Now, we don't have many records of suicide rates, but a Qing decree of 1688 forbidding widows from killing themselves suggests that it was widespread. And speaking of widows, wars compounded the problem by creating lots of them, like in Europe, the Thirty Years War led to a rise in the number of households headed by women. Women also took the lead in reducing the number of mouths to feed by delaying marriage. Like, whenever bread prices rise, rates of marriage fall. And the last thing that I'll mention here\nis that bad weather and poor harvests also prompted migration. Like, in the first half of the seventeenth century, perhaps one half of all adult Scotsmen left Scotland. Many Chinese left for the Philippines, Indonesia, and Taiwan. So, we have a world that's dramatically different because of the climate change of the Little Ice Age. Women head more households, many\ncommunities are more ethnically diverse, population growth slowed dramatically, and there was widespread political unrest and wars and starvation. And, of course, looking at the history of\nthe Little Ice Age is relevant for us today as we face a change in climate and the extreme weather that comes with it. Sometimes, we like to imagine that math and science don't really have much to do with the humanities, that, like, how we live in the world isn't really shaped by our environment. But, of course, it is. We are shaping our\nenvironment. Our environment is also shaping us. To end on a hopeful note, the agricultural\ninnovations that developed in the face of tremendous weather-related challenges should remind us that it is possible to adapt to changing climates if we make the effort and take the time. We don't know what the cast iron plows of the future are going to be, but we do know that we're going to need them. Thanks for watching. I'll see you next week.

    "content": "in july of 1995 something unprecedented went down in chicago a heat wave that ground the entire city to a halt the heat index which measures how the temperature feels to us jumped to a record setting 126 degrees fahrenheit chicago was unprepared as residents cranked up their air conditioning the spike in electrical use led to power outages across the city cars broke down and the city's emergency response units were overwhelmed ambulance services sometimes took two hours to arrive on the scene and then had trouble finding somewhere to take people because hospitals were full and closing their doors to new patients the oppressive heat lasted about a week and it's estimated that up to 739 chicago residents lost their lives from heat-related complications but follow-up reporting revealed that the impact wasn't random a map of deaths showed that the communities most affected were those that suffered from a lack of infrastructure and community resources mostly in the south and west of the city 25 years later chicago found itself staring down a different headline grabbing crisis the covert 19 pandemic early in the pandemic a local news station in chicago analyzed the number of covert deaths in different neighborhoods across the city and an interesting trend appeared the map that emerged showed similarities to the map of chicago's death toll from the 1995 heat wave these maps describe two distinct health outcomes at two different moments 25 years apart yet the story they tell is the same people who live in certain neighborhoods have faced measurably worse health outcomes than those in other neighborhoods to help understand why we need to look at the role that our environment plays in determining our health hi i'm vanessa hill and this is crash course public health [Music] we often think of our environment as the world outside our bodies like we think of ourselves as being in an environment where our skin stops our environment begins but we don't always consider the ways that our environment is sort of part of our bodies sure my body is mainly made up of me but all that oxygen and water that my body depends on comes from somewhere our bodies are biological machines built to turn our environments into stuff we need to survive that's what bodies do but when that environment becomes contaminated or conditions become too extreme our health may be put in jeopardy the environmental factors that affect our health outcomes are what we are calling the environmental determinants of health we can divide these determinants into two major categories the ones related to our natural environment and the ones related to our built environment our natural environment is all that non-human made stuff around us like forests and mountains on the other hand our built environment is the environment we tend to think of as human made like our homes streets or even miniature golf courses when thinking about our environment public health experts generally consider how our built-in natural environments come together to influence a population's overall health for example while we know that the air we breathe and the water we drink aren't human made we can recognize that they are human influenced like if we take in a deep breath of air we're mostly breathing in nitrogen and oxygen but not only those things a closer look reveals there's a whole bunch of other stuff in that breath too air pollution is the stuff in the air that is harmful to the health of both humans and the planet one major airborne pollutant on our public health radar is particulate matter or pm these are particles like dust or smoke that are too small to be seen with the naked eye and can come from things like car exhausts and construction sites this is small enough to work its way into our lungs or even infiltrate our bloodstream the smallest of these particles can be 30 times thinner than a strand of human hair and it turns out when you're that small and light you can hang around in the air for weeks at a time sometimes traveling hundreds of miles which is how smoke from a wildfire in california can travel over 2 000 miles to new york city affecting the air quality across the us now when we picture air pollution we tend to imagine cities full of gas guzzling cars and smoke spewing factories but air pollution can come from other less expected sources that aren't right outside our front door one review found that because of traffic related pollution like car emissions children living as far as 500 meters or about a third of a mile other busy road can experience negative health outcomes like exacerbated asthma the same report estimated that as much as 45 of people in large cities in north america live within that distance from a busy road and the world health organization reports that 99 of the global population breathes air that exceeds their guideline limits for outdoor air pollution which contributes to as many as 4.2 million deaths every year and air pollution isn't just outdoors it's in our homes too some of that can come from outside elements coming in but some of it is introduced by the activities done inside our homes as we cook and clean we're actually introducing potentially harmful particles and chemical compounds into the air which can hang around long enough to eventually work their ways into our bodies gas-based cooking is one of the biggest culprits because it releases things like smoke particles and carbon dioxide that can stick around our homes even baking a cake in a gas oven can emit up to double at the levels of the potentially dangerous gas nitrogen dioxide then us regulators like the epa consider safe for our lungs then there's the problem of water you might have heard of it it's you know most of what you are like air water is part of our natural environment but the systems we've developed to deliver water to our homes like plumbing come with their own set of risks water pollution happens when our water supply becomes contaminated with harmful substances some forms of water pollution feel pretty obvious like a coca-cola can bobbing down a river or the oil spill in the gulf of mexico back in 2010 but others aren't so obvious like when lead leaches out from our pipes and into our drinking water or when fertilizer runs off into a river when it comes to our water supply one of the major pollutants that have public health experts on high alert are purr and polyfluoroalkyl substances or pfas sometimes called forever chemicals these man-made pollutants have a super strong chemical makeup that prevents them from breaking down naturally in the environment over time these chemicals can seep into groundwater eventually working their way into our drinking water and because they're tough to break down many household water filters struggle to totally eliminate these chemicals from our water supply there's a lot we still need to learn about the long-term effects of pfas on the human body but early findings suggest that pfas could trigger negative health outcomes ranging from altered brain development to cancer more than 4 500 of these chemicals are currently used around the world in everything from non-stick pans to fire fighting foam now when it comes to predicting and improving the health of a population one of the biggest factors to consider is the environment in which our homes exist our neighborhoods for instance we know that some people living in the west end of chicago had it worse than others during the 1995 heat wave but it wasn't the same in every neighborhood in that area let's go to the thought bubble to see why in 2002 american sociologist and urban studies expert eric klinenberg published a book comparing two neighborhoods impacted by the heatwave north lawndale and south lawndale both neighborhoods had similar populations of elderly people as well as similar levels of people living in poverty which are factors associated with higher heat-related deaths but when klinenberg looked at the heat-related deaths in the two neighborhoods he found that north lawndale experienced heat-related deaths at a rate 10 times higher than south lawndale compared to south lawndale north londale had significantly more abandoned buildings empty lots and shuttered storefronts fewer community buildings like banks and grocery stores meant that residents without air conditioners in their homes likely had difficulty locating air conditioning in public places to find relief from the heat in addition north lawndale had sidewalks that were in far worse condition than south lawndale which suggested that older residents who don't drive might have been reluctant to leave their homes for fear of falling while walking or unable to leave their homes because damaged sidewalks can be impossible to navigate with a wheelchair north london also had higher rates of violent crime which may have meant that residents were less likely to leave their homes for fear of robbery while they were away they were also less likely to crack open the windows or sleep outside strategies that might have helped them cope with the heat wave these infrastructure challenges and high rates of violent crime also had social implications that came into play during the heat wave the absence of a connected community meant that residents had fewer opportunities to build connections with their neighbours this lack of social cohesion put the residents at risk of severe social isolation and made them less likely to have a social network that they could lean on during the heat wave faced with a lack of suitable options residents remained in the sweltering heat of their homes and for many this proved deadly thanks thought bubble so there's no escaping the influence our environment has on our health but we do have some say in how we manage and build our environments and in who those environments protect decades of studies have found that marginalized and low-income populations are disproportionately exposed to environmental pollutions often because they don't have the support from their government or communities to escape or improve their environments and because their communities are often targets for things like hazardous waste sites enter environmental justice american environmental justice activist dr robert bullard defines environmental justice as the principle that all people and communities are entitled to equal protection of environmental and public health laws and regulations in short the environmental justice movement calls for us to address our shared history of racism exploitation and segregation to create an environment that's healthy for everyone and just to be clear this means improving environments everywhere environmental justice also demands that we find solutions for these unfair and preventable differences in health outcomes not tomorrow not eventually right now what makes the environmental justice movement so urgent is climate change one of the biggest challenges facing our planet climate change is the change in average weather patterns in a region over a long period of time in the last two centuries alone human activity and growth has caused our climate to change at a faster pace than it has even in the last 65 million years in fact the union of concerned scientists estimates that if humans continue to alter the climate at the rate we are now we could see events like that chicago heat wave as often as three times per year by the end of the century now climate change is a global problem and it affects all of us but its effects will always weigh most heavily on communities not equipped with the same tools and support as others these are often groups that have ancestral ties to a particular location who can't afford to relocate or who face other health challenges on top of the ones presented by their environment the good news here is that today public health researchers are working to make the environment work for our health not against it policy makers can work with scientists to create regulations around what we put into our water and air communities can invest in cooling stations and community centres where people can cool off on a hot summer day but maybe most importantly we can continue to better understand and address the parts of our society that make the environmental determinants of health affect us unequally in the first place namely the social determinants of health more on that in the next episode thanks for watching this episode of crash course

    "content": "hello from the internet I'm coming to you on demand through a vast interconnected network of wires and electromagnetic waves that spans the globe and chances are you're watching this in the comfort of your home school or workplace that's lit and heated on demand too you can cook up mac and cheese charge your cell phone and put on the TV to keep the dog company as easy as flipping a switch or pushing a button but none of this would be possible without electricity our lifestyles are centered around electricity and worldwide we consume more than 22 000 terawatt hours every year that's enough to microwave about 2 trillion Mac and cheeses but the way we make electricity is changing hi hi I'm M Jackson and this is Crash Course climate and energy [Music] swimming pools full of mac and cheese aside making all that electricity is taking a toll on Earth's climate power plants running on fossil fuels are pumping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere enhancing in a bad way the planet's greenhouse effect which warms the earth scientists agree that we have to find ways to make electricity without releasing so much carbon dioxide also known as decarbonizing the electricity Supply this would make a huge impact because a little over a quarter of all of our greenhouse gas emissions come from generating electricity and that's not even including the electricity it takes to manufacture things or power large-scale agriculture which are often counted as their own categories when measuring fossil fuel emissions by sector a growing number of countries are committing to becoming carbon neutral by 2050. that means reaching no net carbon emissions by both massively reducing emissions and offsetting the ones we can avoid by scrubbing extra carbon to the air but in an increasingly populous world with an ever-growing appetite for energy this is a challenge we'll need to find a way to decarbonize while also meeting people's needs the good news is we have options some biggies are solar and wind power solar power involves capturing radiation from the Sun and converting it to electricity most often this happens in photovoltaic panels these panels contain metals like Silicon that absorb particles of light called photons and emit electrons those electrons are captured to form an electric current the sun's energy can also be captured on a large scale in what are called concentrating solar power plants here instead of using a bunch of separate panels a big field of mirrors focuses sunlight onto a single receiver where temperatures can reach hundreds of degrees Celsius it's like the coolest laser on the planet that heat can then be used to boil water and create steam which can turn a turbine and generate electricity like in a fossil fuel power plant but crucially it does this without releasing a bunch of carbon dioxide another option is wind power which uses the force of moving air to turn turbines and directly generate electricity there are different turbine designs for different locations but especially if you've ever driven through a rural area you've probably seen some of them in the wild lurking in the fields like strange high-tech crops in the last decade the costs of both wind and solar energy have dropped massively helping to make the more affordable worldwide because of this wind and solar now account for about seven percent of the global electricity Supply and if we built and installed more panels and more turbines that number would go up which would definitely help in reducing carbon dioxide emissions but don't bring out the balloons yet scientists don't think that wind and solar could ever completely replace fossil fuel power plants that's partly because wind and solar need a lot more space for instance to generate the same amount of energy as a one square kilometer power plant you might need 5 000 square kilometers of wind turbines depending on how efficient they are but there's also another major barrier supply and demand let's head to the thought bubble think of the electricity grid as a huge bucket of water the water itself is the electricity if you haven't guessed and when homes and businesses need to use some of that electricity the water flows out of the holes of the bottom of the bucket then through the hoses to the destination so when you flip on the TV for a movie marathon some water flows out and needs to be replaced at the top that's where electricity generation comes in power that comes from fossil fuel power plants is like water pumped from underground into our bucket utility companies can provide a constant flow of water which they can switch on or off to control the amount flowing out of the bottom of the bucket but groundwater going into the bucket just like fossil fuels is finite once it's gone it's gone so instead you could opt to refill your bucket with rain water and like solar and wind power the rain is renewable you'll always be able to get more of it but you have no control over when that rain falls just like you have little control over how much The Sun Shines or the wind blows as convenient as that would be so if you relied on rainfall alone to refill your bucket the levels could get dangerously low or in a big downpour the Pucket might overflow damaging the whole system and then there goes your plans for movie night and potentially your TV thanks thought bubble the key here is that there's a crucial difference between electricity capacity and electricity generation in a given area in a hypothetical world with unlimited space you might be able to install enough solar panels or wind turbines to supply the entire planet with electricity when the sun is shining the brightest or the wind is blowing the hardest but what happens when the sun goes down and the wind drops even though you might have the capacity to supply everyone's needs the conditions outside can't generate the right amount of energy at the right time the supply is intermittent it comes and goes add that to the fact that our electricity usage isn't always the same either there's always some demand for power which is known as a base load but at certain times of the day and year this can increase to a peak load for example say every refrigerator in your neighborhood is always running that's the kitchen's base load but in the evenings when everyone on the Block is cooking dinner and running the dishwasher and has all the lights on the electricity grid will have to supply a lot more power than in the middle of the night when it's just powering the fridge or you know the fridge plus a few people who are reheating pizza for a midnight snack so whatever we use to supply electricity it needs to be able to adapt to these changes and right now our demand for well power on demand just isn't compatible with the intermittency of wind and solar power that's where some other low carbon options come in for instance hydroelectric power makes use of that old adage what goes up must come down essentially you trap huge amounts of water in a reservoir at the top of a hill then you control that flow of water downhill past turbines that spin and make electricity hydroelectricity is renewable since it relies on rain and groundwater water that are replaced through the natural water cycle and after you've built your Reservoir any electricity you generate is carbon neutral as well as long as there's enough water in the reservoir operators can also change the amount of water flowing through the facility to meet varying demand from base load to Peak load right now the biggest hydroelectric facility in the world is at the Three Gorges Dam in China in 2021 it generated enough energy to hypothetically power a small country like the Netherlands worldwide hydroelectric power accounts for about 16 percent of all electricity generation but maybe hold the confetti cannons because it's not all good news building a reservoir capable of powering cities comes with serious environmental and economic consequences Three Gorges took nearly 20 years to build and cost at least 28 billion dollars more than 1.3 million people also had to be moved from their homes and the Yangtze river valleys were submerged more than 600 kilometers Upstream destroying huge swallows of the natural environment also hydroelectric plants only really work when you have plenty of water and plenty of drop realistically a flat country like the Netherlands could never hope to power itself hydroelectrically so another alternative and one that can be a bit more flexible is nuclear power when you hit a large atom of uranium with another particle the uranium undergoes nuclear fission it breaks down into other elements while releasing Heat by harnessing that fission in a controlled Chain Reaction the generated heat can be used to create Steam and turn a turbine just like in a fossil fuel power plant the benefit here is that nuclear fission doesn't release any carbon and by carefully tweaking the amount of fission happening at any time the plant can easily ramp up production to meet Peak demand now uranium fuel itself isn't renewable so there's only a limited Supply but the next generation of nuclear plants is finding ways to make it last longer by using one of the leftovers from uranium Vision to make even more heat after round one right now nuclear fission supplies around 10 percent of the world's electricity and since it's so flexible and scales up so well it could Supply more but there are significant challenges building nuclear power plants is costly and slow and there have also been a few high-profile and devastating accidents throughout the years power plants at Three Mile Island Chernobyl and Fukushima all made headlines when they're dangerously radioactive insides leaked outside in reality far more people have been killed by air pollution from fossil fuel power plants than nuclear accidents but there's still a level of risk not everyone is comfortable with solar wind hydroelectric nuclear the point here is that there's not going to be a single solution to completely decarbonizing our electricity Supply it's going to take a variety of Technologies and none of these transitions will be cheap compared with fossil fuel sources all low carbon options come with what's known as a green premium over the years many countries have done what they can to keep the price of fossil fuels low in order to boost their economies and technological development they've tapped into whatever fuel reserves they have nearby and provided tax cuts and subsidies to allow companies to produce and use that fuel cheaply that means any new technology that doesn't use fossil fuels seems artificially expensive even while the resources themselves like sunlight wind might be free installing new facilities also requires research and development as well as new infrastructure and right now there aren't many policies out there to reduce that cost these are not insurmountable challenges though the incredible thing is that if we can decarbonize electricity it'll have an impact on the other major industries that currently release greenhouse gases new generations of vehicles can be fueled by carbon free electricity instead of guzzling tankfuls of gas and homes can be heated efficiently without emitting carbon dioxide decarbonizing electricity would even help the agricultural industry not by electrifying the crop somehow but by powering everything that goes into growing them we're talking electrifying tractors pumps and watering systems the machines that pick your green beans heavy equipment that currently runs on fossil fuels and for the emissions that are left researchers are looking into ways to capture the excess carbon and lock it away where it can't cause further warming so decarbonizing our electricity supplies won't solve the climate crisis by its self but it can take us a good way in that direction someday soon the electricity that powers your internet or your midnight Pizza might come from something like solar or hydroelectric power in fact it might already that being said the biggest hurdle to large-scale carbon-free electricity won't actually be generating it but rather storing and transmitting it so we can use it exactly when and where we need it in other words we need to seriously improve our water buckets we'll explore how we do that and why it's harder than you might Imagine Next time special thanks to John Lee this episode's mac and cheese caterer John we're

    "content": "after centuries of continuously burning fossil fuels humanity is starting to see the consequences we've created extreme climate change but today more and more people are working towards Solutions scientists and Engineers are developing carbon-free Technologies students are encouraging schools to start composting programs and activists are putting pressure on organizations to stop funding fossil fuel projects just to name a few examples but ultimately getting the global change we need also means getting entire nations to cooperate which is about as easy as herding cats I know I have two each country has their own approach to climate policy they're not obligated to submit to anyone else's Authority and sometimes following through with their plans it doesn't always make it on the agenda but every now and then these cats manage to pull off something amazing hi hi I'm M Jackson and this is Crash Course climate and energy [Music] since the late 1980s the international scientific Community has researched and compiled information about the climate crisis they want to know what's up who's going to be affected and what we can do about it normally scientific results are presented at a conference session attended by a few dozen scientists and maybe one or two members of the press but because climate change is so important this conversation has expanded to include representatives from almost every country it's like the science Avengers when these teams get together they look at the evidence decide the best course of action and devise various treaties and declarations and agreements to try to address the problem together these documents form the basis for international climate policy and right now almost every country is signed on to one or more of the major climate and environmental agreements or groups they're called the unep the ipcc and the UNF Triple C I know it sounds like I just pulled a handful of Scrabble letters out of a bag but government agencies and in particular the UN sorry I mean the United Nations they do love their acronyms cut what technically their initialisms oh give me a break moving on first up the unep is the United Nations environment program it was established in 1972 when the UN made its first declaration to protect the environment called the Stockholm declaration and today the unep is the global Authority advocating for the environment in 1988 the unep teamed up with the World Meteorological organization to form a subgroup focusing just on climate change the ipcc because if there's anything governments love more than acronyms it's subgroups and subcommittees of the subgroups the ipcc stands for the intergovernmental panel on climate change it's made up of hundreds of scientists researchers and policy makers tasked with compiling everything we know about the earth's climate climate change and how to mitigate it and adapt since the 80s they've released six comprehensive reports these reports are kind of like the SparkNotes versions of that book you forgot to read for class at one time the ipcc takes thousands of peer-reviewed research articles and condenses them into detailed summaries imagine the ultimate book report written by scientists these and a few other reports represent some of the most comprehensive and collaborative international science ever and when these reports have been picked up by the media they've helped launch waves of awareness and activism across the world so you've got the unep the ipcc subgroup and finally our last acronym with the highest Scrabble score goes to the UNF Triple C while the ipcc is focused on compiling and Reporting knowledge about climate science the United Nations framework convention on climate change is about the other side of the coin how we put that knowledge into action as an International Community it's essentially a treaty signed in 1992 by 154 countries to try and combat quote dangerous human interference in the climate system AKA what's been happening since we started burning fossil fuels during the Industrial Revolution every year members of the signing countries meet for a conference of the parties or cop which is another acronym sorry I betrayed you like that anyway the cop meets to discuss progress and new approaches to tackling climate change for instance in 2015 the cop meeting in Paris resulted in the Paris agreement which set a long-term goal to reduce climate warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius ideally 1.5 degrees we'll come back to this agreement in a minute for now though there's your list the unep the ipcc and the UNF Triple C with so many committees and resolutions it really seems like we should have climate change in the bag but you know humans aren't always the best at sticking to big plans like don't even ask me about the running goals I set last New Year's similarly these International agreements have been a mixed bag sometimes Nations lace up their running shoes and sometimes they take a nap for example one of the first major agreements to emerge from the conference of parties was the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 adopted at a meeting in you guessed it Kyoto Japan countries that signed up to the Kyoto Protocol were legally committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by a set amount within specific time frames if they didn't make their targets they could be penalized by International courts which seemed like a good motivator except the Kyoto Protocol has largely been considered a failure much like my 5K training the targets within the agreement were not made legally binding for developing countries so fast-growing industrial economies like China and India had no legal obligation that decision had Ripple effects the biggest greenhouse gas emitter in the world at the time the United States disagreed with that exclusion so effectively decided not to participate in the Kyoto Protocol at all without the US on board many people questioned the usefulness of the protocol and at the end of the commitment period greenhouse gas emissions were higher than ever so a little under 20 years later countries returned to the starting line to try again this time the cop drafted the Paris agreement with the goal to reduce climate warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius and the UNF Triple C had learned from their mistakes the first time around while the Kyoto Protocol had been legally binding the Paris agreement was voluntary the idea was that each country would draft a plan outlining how they would reduce emissions then theoretically peer pressure from other members would help everyone stick to those commitments it would be like if I joined a running group who helped me stick to my routine by sticking to theirs the Paris agreement also encouraged Nations to commit a total of a hundred billion dollars a year to the green climate fund as a way for wealthier countries to fund things like decarbonization in lower income countries this was a huge step forward and a big shift in climate policy it was a switch from strict legal rule setting to a more collaborative process but the green climate fund is where this more flexible policy falls down without clear ways to report and enforce how much money countries are contributing not all the expected money made it into the piggy bank for instance only about 83 billion of the hundred billion dollars was raised in 2020. to be fair 83 billion dollars is still one huge piggy bank you could probably live in that thing for me pay off my student loans I am talking Scrooge McDuck swimming in Gold coined levels of magnitude here but a 17 billion dollar difference is also a world-changing gap now it might seem like the solution to this is obvious just make the Paris agreement more strict right I mean even voluntary accountability groups have penalties say you and your friends all agree to not check your phones while you're out to dinner if someone does they definitely have to buy dessert but there's some tension there in 1972 the Stockholm declaration the one from the unep that kick-started International action for the environment included the principle that every nation has the right to govern itself except any climate policy that's effective on the international stage will mean countries submitting to some kind of overarching governance but no one is actually required to do that so you see it gets messy this idea of national sovereignty or the right of countries to govern themselves was brought up when countries objected to the legally binding Kyoto Protocol and some of the more strict commitments proposed for the Paris agreement so now we have the Paris agreements more flexible targets but will that work for the long term stay tuned for the next season of life on Earth another problem that remains to be solved is the inequality between countries historically countries with weaker economies have smaller voices in international discussions which is especially problematic since they're the ones who tend to feel the worst impacts of climate change and when it comes to making plans for the future they often don't get the attention or the action they need but there is one international policy that gets a gold star take it away thought bubble from the 1980s through at least the early 2000s everyone used to talk about the infamous hole in the ozone a protective layer of the Earth's atmosphere and it was a big deal but now you never hear about it and that's partly thanks to the success of the Montreal protocol it's an international treaty enacted by the unep in 1987. in the era of big hair and acid wash jean jackets and to date it's the only International agreement that's been ratified by every one of the 198 U.N member states but it's not a climate agreement it was introduced to limit and phase out the production of chemicals that attacked the ozone layer called CFCs or for the Scrabble win chlorofluorocarbons and it has a lot going for it it has strict legally binding targets for each nation and annual meetings that can change those targets as needed unlike the Kyoto Protocol countries were also willing to sign up for it and now the hole in the ozone layer is healing itself these days the protocol scope is expanded into the climate realm but the Kigali amendment in 2016. it adds a group of chemicals called hydrofluorocarbons or hfcs to the list of regulated substances hfcs don't attack the ozone layer but they are super strong greenhouse gases used in things like air conditioners and if the Kigali amendment is effective experts suggest that by the end of the century we can prevent the average global temperature from going up a full half degree celsius thanks stop bubble the Montreal protocol is an example of how we could get International climate policy right and the Kigali Amendment goes to show how climate change can be integrated into existing policies if you already have a way of doing something that works it's a lot easier just to expand that approach than to invent a whole new set of rules and processes which makes me think maybe I should combine my running schedule with my daily coffee run ultimately climate policy is a pretty young form of governance so we're still trying to work out the best way to do it and only time will tell which strategies will be the most effective smaller countries activists and the public will also continue to have a bigger and bigger role in these conversations as more seats are made available at the table whatever we do though we've got our work cut out for us because even Beyond passing laws we'll need to find an approach that helps overcome the cultural political and economic challenges faced by each and every nation on Earth motnt

    "content": "Engineering has given a lot to the world. It’s transformed the nature of work, improved\nsanitation and helped create vital infrastructure. The bad news is that to power the tools and\nprocesses behind those developments, we’ve\nrelied on non-renewable fuels – the kind that get produced at a much\nslower rate than we use them. As the name implies, non-renewables won’t\nbe around forever. Resources like oil and natural gas might be\ngone in just half a century. And using them has been, frankly, pretty terrible\nfor the environment. 87% of the harmful carbon dioxide emitted by humans in the last 50 years has come from burning fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas, known collectively as fossil fuels. It’s been terrible for the atmosphere and oceans,\nand is changing our climate in dangerous ways. Whether we like it or not, we’re gonna have\nto find new ways to power our world. [Theme Music] Despite their terrible effects on the environment\nand limited supply, for now, non-renewables do\na really good job of meeting our energy needs. In 2017, 80% of the power used in the United\nStates was supplied using fossil fuels. And the need for energy doesn’t appear to\nbe shrinking any time soon. Another 9% was delivered from nuclear fission,\nthe process of splitting atoms, which releases\nfar less CO2. Unfortunately, fission produces radioactive\nwaste and also relies on non-renewable fuel\nsources such as uranium and plutonium. All of these methods operate on broadly the\nsame principle, essentially operating as a\nheat engine. A working fluid, often water, is heated by\nthe fuel to expand and do work, turning the\nblades of a turbine. The turbine is connected to an electrical generator\nthat converts the rotational motion of the blades into\nelectrical power, which is then fed into the grid. So what about that remaining 11% of power? That came from renewable energy sources – the\nkind that are generated about as fast as we use them. Some of the major renewable energy sources\ncome from processes that are naturally occurring\non Earth: wind power; solar power; hydropower – which is\nbased on flowing water; and geothermal power,\nwhich uses the heat of the Earth deep underground. None of these sources are things we’ll run\nout of – we have a good few billion years \nleft of sunlight, for example. And what’s more, renewable energy tends\nto release fewer harmful byproducts, like\ncarbon dioxide, into the environment. Take hydropower, for example, which converts\nthe kinetic energy from the motion of running\nwater into electrical power. In a fast flowing river, a run-of-river power plant\ndiverts part of the river’s flow, sometimes through\na tunnel, to turn the turbinesof a generator. That works well in some places, but the problem\nwith this approach is that it’s tricky to control the\ngeneration of energy to meet demand. You don’t want to put lots of power into the grid when\nit won’t get used, and you want to be able to ramp up\nthe supply when the demand suddenly spikes. Like during the halftime break when the English\nfootball team – that’s soccer to you Americans –\nplayed Colombia in the 2018 World Cup. A huge number of people in the UK opened their\nrefrigerators to grab a drink or a snack, causing\nthe compressors inside them to turn on. Then there were the people who’d already\nhad a bunch of drinks. All those people simultaneously flushing their toilets during the break created an increased demand for power on the local pumping stations that maintain pressure in the water system. The total increase in demand was measured\nto be 1200 megawatts. That’s an extra demand for power equivalent\nto several power plants! With fossil fuels, you can control the amount\nof fuel being burned, and therefore the amount\nof power being produced. Run-of-river power plants struggle with this\nbecause the amount of power they generate\ndepends on the flow of the river, which in turn depends on things like the rainfall\nduring the time period and even the temperature –\nboth things we can’t control. To get around this, the more common form of\nhydropower is a hydroelectric dam. In this case, you can install a dam that floods\nan area and creates a huge reservoir of water. The water then falls through the generator’s\nturbines at the bottom of the dam, which turn\nthe water’s kinetic energy into power. If you install an intake valve that opens\nor shuts to control the water flow through it, you can even manage the production of energy to\nmeet the changing demands of the electrical grid. Unfortunately, flooding an area with water\nisn’t consequence-free. Changing the environment so suddenly and preventing\nthe natural flow of water downstream can have\ndevastating consequences for the local ecology. There’s also the risk of the dam breaking\nif it was built improperly. Despite those challenges, hydropower has been\nenormously helpful. In recent years, it’s produced as much as\n16% of the world’s energy and up to 70%\nof all the world’s renewable energy. The other renewable energy source that works\nvery similarly to hydropower is wind power,\nwhich also uses turbines. The main difference is that the fluid doing\nwork on the wind turbines is air instead of\nwater. One of the biggest engineering challenges\nhere is designing the turbine blades to efficiently\nextract energy from that air. As we saw with fluid mechanics, predicting\nthe flow of a fluid around an object can get\nseriously tricky! Blades have to be engineered to withstand the stress\nthey’re subjected to while also allowing the wind to\nefficiently rotate them to power the generator. It’s as complicated as designing an airplane\nwing. Once again, you run into the problem of demand:\nyou can’t control the strength of the wind to increase\nor decrease power generation as you need it. Even if that were possible, you’d still have to\ntransport it from the sparsely populated, open\nplains where the wind blows more easily, to dense urban centers with low amounts of\nwind but high demand for power. Transporting that power becomes even trickier\nover long distances because you lose some energy\nas the electricity travels through the wires. For that reason and others, engineering considerations\noften play a big role in deciding where wind farms (as\na collection of turbines is known) should be built. So wind power has only generated 4% of the\nworld’s total power supply in recent years. Location also plays an important role in another\nrenewable energy source: geothermal power. Like conventional power plants, geothermal\npower relies on steam as the working fluid\non the turbines connected to the generator. But in this case, you don’t need fuel to\ngenerate the steam. You can drill into underground deposits of hot, volcanic rocks, normally near the Earth’s tectonic plate boundaries, to use them as a heat source for a power plant. Then, all you need is to pump water to that\nlocation and create another channel for steam\nto rise through to do work on the turbines. The biggest problem comes with setting up\na geothermal power plant in the first place. It can be expensive to drill and explore for\nunderground conditions that are exactly right, and is only really possible in certain parts\nof the world, like Iceland and Italy. But there’s one source of renewable energy\nthat’s so abundant and easily accessible you only have to step outside on a bright\nsunny day to see it: solar energy! In fact, the amount of sunlight the Earth\nreceives in just a single year is twice the total amount of energy that will ever\nbe extracted from fossil fuels and the uranium used\nin nuclear fission, combined. The challenge is finding efficient ways to\nharness that energy, because turning sunlight \ninto electricity isn’t simple. The most promising technology we have is called\nthe photovoltaic, or simply, PV cell. Most people know them by the name given to\nmany cells arranged together: solar panels! Unlike everything else we’ve looked at,\nthere’s no trace of a turbine here. Instead, as we saw when looking at semiconductors, solar panels use two different semiconducting pieces to set up an electrical field that biases the movement of free electrons inside the material in a particular direction. In short, the materials encourage an electrical\ncurrent to flow when they receive energy, which then travels through the circuit delivering\npower to whatever’s connected to the PV cell. That means solar panels can deliver power\ndirectly to the grid. Between that and the abundance of sunlight,\nit seems like there shouldn’t be an energy\nshortage problem at all. But, as we’ve seen for the other energy\nsources, costs, fluctuating demand, location,\nand transmission all factor in here. For starters, solar cells aren’t all that\nefficient. The very best solar cells can convert 40%\nof the energy they absorb into electrical power, but they’re expensive to produce because of\nthe high quality of silicon needed in manufacturing,\namong other reasons. On average, industrial PV cells are about\n17% efficient. Once you factor in the cost of making the cells and energy storage, solar power ends up being anywhere between 3-6 times as expensive to produce as that from fossil fuels. Increasing solar panels’ efficiency would\nbring this down dramatically. Another big challenge with solar power is that, like with the hydroelectric dam, you need a way to store energy to control the production in line with power demand. You won’t generate much solar power on a\ncloudy day, whereas you might have a surplus\non sunny days. But you can’t store sunlight directly! Instead, engineers are working on ways to\ntemporarily store that extra solar power. These include solutions like batteries, or even\npumping water up a column to later give up its energy\nas hydropower during periods of high demand. Once again though, efficiency plays a big\nrole in making both of these methods a suitable\nform of energy storage. Despite the efficiency and storage problems,\nthere is one major advantage to solar panels:\nthey can be deployed pretty much anywhere. Rather than having to transmit power across\nlong distances, solar panels can simply be installed\non smaller scales close to areas of demand – even on the roof of an individual home. But manufacturing the panels themselves brings\nits own set of issues. One of the raw materials used to currently make solar\npanels is quartz, which has to be processed to produce\nthe high quality silicon needed for making PV cells. This itself is an energy intensive process,\nwhich offsets some of the total energy production\nof solar panels across their lifetime of usage. Even worse, processing quartz can often produce toxic byproducts like tetrachloride, which can end up spilling into the environment and causing damage to soil. That all sounds a little bleak, but the most\ndifficult challenges in engineering are often\nthe most important ones. In fact, the National Academy of Engineering\nin the US has identified making solar energy more economical as one of the Grand Challenges that engineers in the 21st Century need to solve. Future engineers have lots of ways to contribute\ntowards making solar more feasible. Currently, researchers are looking at new\nstorage systems, such as using solar power\nto drive hydrogen fuel production, which can be burned later on with no\ncarbon dioxide emissions. More on that next time. Engineers are also introducing new materials into the production of solar panels, and improving the ways in which PV cells themselves are linked and arranged on the panels. There are even experimental methods being\ndeveloped that use new structures on a molecular\nlevel, called nanocrystals. These increase the amount of energy given to the\nelectrons in the material when ligh is absorbed\ninstead of losing the energy as heat. That could drive the efficiency high enough to make it\neconomically competitive with current power sources\nand increase the adoption of solar worldwide. So there are lots of challenges ahead in bringing\nrenewable energy sources to the forefront\nof electrical power production. But that’s all the more space for future\nengineers to have an impact and create new\nsolutions to the world’s energy needs! In this episode we looked at renewable energy\nsources and why we need them. We looked at how hydropower, wind, geothermal,\nand solar power are used to produce electricity, some of the challenges faced in doing so,\nand the areas engineers are working on to\nmake their use more widespread. In our next episode, we’ll see how engineers\nhave moved beyond natural processes, to invent\nentirely new ways of generating power.

    "content": "The future is going to require us to make\nsome dramatic changes to the way we produce\nand consume electrical power. Climate change is happening whether we like it or not,\nand switching to cleaner sources of energy is the main\nway we’ll be able to keep it from getting worse. And we’ll run out of fossil fuels eventually\nanyway. That’s why engineers are looking for ways to scale some\nof the existing sources of energy that don’t rely on fossil\nfuels, and maybe even find sources that are entirely new. There are all kinds of promising candidates\n– from nuclear fusion to plain old hydrogen to\n…poop. [Theme Music] For at least the last 450 million years, another\nform of life has been harvesting all it needs from the\nsun without doing any harm to the planet. I’m talking about plants. The chlorophyll in a plant’s cells absorb light\nand use its energy to combine carbon dioxide and\nwater to produce glucose and oxygen. That’s photosynthesis. Eliminating some carbon dioxide from the atmosphere\nand producing the oxygen we breathe is already pretty\ngreat, but there’s another useful aspect to this. When the plants store some of that glucose,\nit’s also storing chemical energy. And where there’s energy, there’s an engineer\nwho will find a way to use it. Biomass energy is a form of energy that relies\non burning biological matter, like plants, either\ndirectly or by processing them into a fuel. As it burns, the chemical energy stored in\nthe plant’s matter is converted into heat. Like with many of the other energy sources\nwe’ve mentioned, the heat turns water into steam,\nwhich in turn does work on a turbine; in other words, it drives a heat engine. A generator then converts the turbine’s\nmotion into electrical power. About half of all biomass energy is delivered by\nburning plant matter directly, which humans have\nbeen doing long before the need for electrical power. A wood burning stove can keep your house warm\nin the winter, or it can be used as a heat source for\nsomething else – to cook pizza, for example. On a larger scale, scrap wood left over from wood processing or from waste produced by humans, along with food waste, can be burned in power plants more directly. Most of the other half of biomass energy comes\nfrom processing biological matter into biogas\nor biofuel. By pulping and chemically treating biomass\nderived from crops and other plant matter, it becomes easier for special proteins called\nenzymes to chemically break it down into a\nmore readily usable fuel source. One example of this is our old friend ethanol\n– the type of alcohol you’ll also find in drinks. Ethanol is produced from enzymes breaking\ndown crops such as wheat or corn. That can then be turned into a liquid fuel\nsuitable for burning. But it’s not just plants that we extract\nenergy from! As certain types of agricultural waste, like\nmanure, decay, they can release what’s known\nas biogas. These are gases like methane that can be burned\nas a source of fuel. There’s also another small contributor to\nbiogas production: human waste. When I said engineers will find a way to get\nenergy from everything, I meant everything. Biofuels are already being used pretty widely. In Brazil, 4 out of every 5 cars produced\nhave hybrid engines capable of burning both\nordinary gasoline and bio-ethanol. To be clear, burning biomass fuels does\nrelease carbon dioxide into the atmosphere,\njust like fossil fuels. But, because a nearly equivalent amount of\nCO2 is captured from the atmosphere during\nphotosynthesis to store chemical energy, on the balance of things, biomass energy is\nwhat’s known as carbon neutral. We can also always grow more plants, which\nmakes biomass more renewable than fossil fuels. But given that plants absorb CO2 as they grow,\nyou could argue that we shouldn’t just release\nit all back by burning them. And processing biomass into biofuels often\nrequires some amount of energy input, which\nindirectly releases more CO2. Humans already use about a third of all the\nCO2-absorbing plant matter on Earth. Destroying even more of those plants to release\nenergy could be catastrophic for certain ecosystems. And even though we could grow more plants, we’d\nhave to trade off the use of land, water, and chemical\nresources between growing food or providing energy. Demand for all of those resources is already high,\nand projected to continue growing pretty quickly. As with any other power system, there are\nplaces where engineers can make better of\nuse of what’s already there, like improving the design of those hybrid engines\nthat burn both ordinary gasoline and biofuels. We also might be able to use different biomass\nsources, like algae, or find more efficient chemical\nreactions for processing biomass into fuel. That might unlock new, more sustainable ways\nto use biomass for power. But there are other futuristic power sources\nthat don’t release any CO2 while being consumed. Although as we’ll see, that doesn’t mean\nthey’re carbon neutral! Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the\nuniverse, which makes it pretty surprising that\npure hydrogen is very rarely found on Earth. It consists of a single proton and electron, and\nif you can produce it, it’s the perfect source of fuel\nfor the very aptly named hydrogen fuel cell. Fuel cells of this kind use a chemical reaction\nbetween hydrogen and oxygen to directly generate\nelectrical power. And the only other byproduct of this\nreaction is water. Much better than carbon dioxide. There’s a fairly big problem, though. If hydrogen isn’t naturally produced on\nEarth, how do you get it? You can use the process known as electrolysis\nto chemically separate water into hydrogen\nand oxygen, and just store the hydrogen. Except, performing electrolysis uses energy. In fact, producing hydrogen fuel requires\nmore energy to produce than you get from using\nit in a fuel cell. Efficiency-wise, that’s not great. But there are good arguments for having hydrogen\nfuel cells in your power-producing arsenal. For starters, because hydrogen is the lightest\nelement, hydrogen fuel is incredibly lightweight, which\nmakes it great for transport, like on spacecraft. And unlike solar-powered devices, if you\nhave hydrogen fuel at the ready, fuel cells don’t\nrequire recharging like batteries. So they’re great for indoor vehicles like\nforklifts, where releasing lots of fumes could\nbe problematic, but you also need to use them pretty much\ncontinuously, which makes batteries less practical. Finally, if we can efficiently produce hydrogen\nfuel by electrolysis from the surplus energy\nprovided by solar power on especially sunny days, hydrogen fuel could give us a carbon \nneutral way of storing electricity. On a larger scale, there is a power producing\nprocess you’ve already heard of that’s already used\nto provide a good deal of energy – 10% in the US – while releasing comparatively tiny amounts\nof CO2: nuclear fission. In fission, an atom splits in two, releasing\na lot of energy in the process. Nuclear power releases the same amount or\neven less of those greenhouse gases than most\nrenewable energy sources. But don’t be fooled, it’s a non-renewable\nsource of energy! The main fuel used in nuclear fission, uranium 2-3-5,\nis a limited resource that has to be mined and purified\nfrom the ground, much like fossil fuels. The way we get power from uranium is by\nassembling rods of uranium parallel to one another\nand setting up a chain reaction. The nucleus, or core, of a uranium atom is\nmade up of protons and neutrons. If a fast moving neutron hits a uranium atom at\njust the right energy, it can split the uranium in two. The uranium splits into atoms of other elements,\nlike krypton and barium. But three of the neutrons from the nucleus\nwill fly off, carrying some energy with them. Those neutrons can then collide with another\nuranium atom, causing fission that releases\neven more neutrons, and so on. Meanwhile, the cascade of splitting atoms\ngives off gamma radiation and heat, heating\nup the reactor. So fission turns a nuclear reactor into a\nheat source for a power plant. Unfortunately, once you’ve used up all the useful\nuranium in the rods, you’re left over with the biggest\nsetback of nuclear power: nuclear waste. Nuclear waste consists of radioactive material that\nemits highly energetic particles that can be extremely\ndangerous for any living thing, including humans. Dealing with it safely is the sort of issue\nnuclear engineers can help with. They also design nuclear power plants to\ncarefully control fission to stop it turning into\na runaway process. If that happens, it can lead to disasters\nlike the kind that happened in Chernobyl or\nFukushima. As for nuclear waste, nuclear engineers aim\nto find as safe a way as possible for disposing\nof it. Most of the time, used-up uranium rods are put into\nthick steel containers and buried in deep underground\nvaults far from any people, or kept in tanks near the nuclear power\nplants themselves. Neither of these solutions is ideal, and engineers\nmay find a better way of handling the problem\nin the future. But it would be better if we could find a\nway of generating nuclear power that produces\nno radioactive fuel as waste at all. Which is where nuclear fusion comes in. It’s the same energy-releasing process that\noccurs in the sun. So naturally, getting it to happen here on\nEarth is something many engineers are looking\ninto! In fact, the National Academy of Engineers in the US\nhas declared the goal of providing energy from fusion\none of its grand challenges for the 21st Century, in addition to the improved solar power we\ntalked about last time. The major setbacks to providing energy from\nfusion are the intense amounts of heat and\npressure that atoms need to fuse. Without the gravitational strength of the sun on hand,\nnuclear physicists and engineers have to design some\nof the world’s most powerful magnets to contain plasma: an extremely hot gas made up of ions, or\natoms with an electric charge. Unfortunately, the magnets require energy to operate,\nso fusion has to deliver more power than the magnets\nconsume for it to be useful. And we haven’t figured out how to do that\nyet. In 2018, a test reactor in the U.K. announced they’d\nreached temperatures of 15 million °C in a plasma –\nwell on the way to a sustainable fusion reaction. And currently under construction in the South\nof France is what will be the world’s biggest\nfusion plant, called ITER. The design is still experimental, but the hope is that it will be capable of delivering the first ever self-sustaining fusion process capable of generating more power than the magnets consume. Engineers have already contributed to the\neffort by designing more efficient magnets\nand contributing to the design of ITER itself. But if fusion ends up being a suitable power\nsource, they’ll have a lot more work left to do\nto scale it for wider use. Between the sources like solar and wind power\nwe talked about last time, and less-developed tech like nuclear fusion, there\nare lots of different ways we can change the future\nof energy for a world less reliant on fossil fuels. No matter what, we’ll need a new power infrastructure\nto support the cleaner energy world of the future. And that infrastructure, that future, will\nbe built by engineers. In this episode we looked at alternative energy\nsources. We saw how biomass can be burned as a fuel\nsource, how hydrogen can be used in a fuel\ncell to generate electrical power, and how nuclear fission provides power to the grid. Finally, we saw how nuclear fusion might someday\ndo the same without any radioactive waste. Next time, we’ll be looking at ways of storing\nall that power when we look at energy storage\nand batteries. Check out our new Augumented Reality Poster,\navailable now at dftba.com!

    "content": "say you wanted to power the entire Earth with solar power I estimate you would need around oh a hundred and twelve thousand square kilometers of at least a moderately efficient photoviteic panels if that sounds like a lot that's because it is but it's also not because those panels could also all fit in just a little more than one percent of the Saharan Desert and with the falling cost of solar panels it could be done way more cheaply than making the same amount of Power with nuclear fuel but like we talked about last time in episode three there's a big problem with relying on renewable resources like solar and wind what happens to our electricity When the Sun Goes Down sometimes the rotation of the earth can be a real bummer another problem we need reliable ways to store and transmit electricity so that it's available when and where we need it and that is going to require a lot more technology and a lot more space hi hi I'm M Jackson and this is Crash Course climate and energy [Music] electricity rules our lives we use it from the moment we wake up and check our phones when we cook when we work wind down when we watch YouTube videos all the way to the end of the day when we switch off the lights and watch more YouTube and then eventually go to sleep electricity won this MVP status thanks to its versatility as an energy carrier as tiny particles called electrons flow within conductive materials think copper aluminum gold or really any metal they push energy from one place to another and that energy can be used to do anything you could dream of or at least designed for it can heat your home it can heat your takeout it can even help power those agricultural processes that lead to your takeout and manufacture the plastic container your takeout comes in so decarbonizing electricity could go a long way to decarbonizing many adjacent Industries like construction agriculture Transportation but like you can probably guess by this point that's easier said than done right now all of our homes and industries are connected to their electricity Supply by a vast electric grid last time we compared that electric grid to a bucket of water imagine this time the bucket is the grid and and the electricity is the water power plants put water into the bucket and then when you flip the lights on that water flows through a hose to wherever you are crucially the utility companies are the bucket managers it's their job to control the flow of electricity in and out of the bucket and make sure it stays full throughout the day traditionally power plants that use fossil fuels have produced electricity on demand to effectively pump water back into the bucket to replace whatever is used up but as we lean more on renewable resources like wind and solar we won't have that flexibility we don't get a pick when the sun shines or when the wind blows and that can lead to overproduction basically on a really sunny or really windy day so much water could be poured into the bucket that it could overflow and damage the whole system to avoid this utility companies do something called curtailment where they selectively switch off solar panels or wind turbines at their most productive times if you've ever noticed a wind turbine not spinning on a pretty windy day and wondered why well there's a good chance that's why let's head to the thought bubble the amount of electricity a neighborhood uses varies during the day depending on people's habits and as much as we like to feel unique we really are habitual creatures in the morning you and your neighbors get up turn the lights on make coffee watch YouTube videos so the load on the electric grid gradually ramps up after that things tend to stay pretty constant during the day because you're either gone or because you're working at home with the same lights and same devices drawing power but then comes evening people are coming home it's getting dark so you're turning on more lights around the house cooking food playing music chilling in front of the TV so the load on the grid Peaks to its highest level of the day then as everyone goes to bed electricity usage tails off to its lowest levels but this curve of Rise flat Peak and drop changes when you add solar panels panels produce most of their electricity during the day so they easily meet the demand of the midday plateau in fact the electric grid is being asked to supply less power than what's being produced so wind and solar power plants may even switch off to avoid overproduction but then comes evening and it's like one minute you're jogging at a comfortable pace and the next you're sprinting full speed away from a bear or towards an ice cream truck Peak demand happens right when the Sun goes down so good night solar power the base load fossil fuel and nuclear power plants suddenly have to step in to supply all the electricity ramping up production very quickly to pick up the slack this pattern of midday sag and steep evening incline has a name the duck curve because if you squint and tilt your head to the side it kind of looks like a duck look we don't make the names here thanks thought bubble as cute as it sounds the duck curve spells trouble for the electricity Grid it's really inefficient and definitely not economical for power plants to keep switching off and then ramping up Supply so quickly that doesn't mean solar panels are bad idea there's still carbon free renewable energy but the way we do electricity just wasn't made for them now one way to get around this is to change our habits that's called load shifting basically we could start using most of our electricity when it's cheapest to generate that could mean running the washing machine in the middle of the night when there's less Demand on the grid or it could mean switching on an electric heater in the day when solar power is the most plentiful those individual changes add up but as we talked about before and we'll talk about again tackling climate change isn't just about you it's about collaboration and even if everybody did midnight laundry that wouldn't be enough to completely flatten the duct curve plus what about when you really need to binge a nature show during Peak evening hours or at any time of the day or night when a hospital needs electricity to perform surgeries take X-rays keep Vital sign monitors running for that there's another solution we could level out the duck curve by storing electricity when it's made in excess and dishing it out when we need it the most for example any extra electricity solar panels make during the day could be stored and then used in the evening so power plants don't have to work as hard and there are already multiple ways we could make this happen first you've got electrochemical storage AKA your everyday battery batteries contain charged particles and when you plug in your phone those particles go from one end of the battery to the other and hang out there until you need them then when you unplug your phone and start scrolling through cat photos the particles release energy by whipping back to the other side of the battery generating an electric current is the go batteries are fast and easy to charge they're relatively safe and portable and they can hold their energy for a very long time the trouble is electrochemical batteries often use metals that are rare on Earth so assembling enough of them to store electricity for an entire grid would be costly to extract these Rare Earth minerals you would need big mining operations that would damage the environment which is kind of the opposite of what we're going for here so instead excess electrical energy could be stored by chemical means we'd use extra electricity to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen in a process called electrolysis then when we needed electricity later we could generate it using a hydrogen fuel cell here the hydrogen entered chamber with a special membrane the membrane lets prior to the hydrogen atoms pass through their positively charged protons but the negatively charged electrons have to take a different path to the other end of the fuel cell and that stream of electrons creates an electric current the only waste product here is water so this is a carbon free option that uses and regenerates one of the Earth's most abundant resources the catch hydrogen is a really lightweight gas meaning its molecules are quite spread out so it takes up a lot of space and is difficult to compress into small containers or storage so there's a third option that's carbon free and it deals with regular unsplit water it's called mechanical energy when there's electricity to spare water is pumped to the top of a big hill and kept there in a reservoir then when electricity is needed again water is released to turn a turbine and generate power on demand this is basically the same technology as a hydroelectric Dam you just add an uphill pump so this is something we could actually develop relatively easily but it's not the most efficient technology you need a huge space and at least one big hill for a reservoir if you're going to rely on gravity alone sorry Kansas so the last option is thermal energy storage here excess electricity is used to heat a material with a high boiling point like molten salt some salts don't melt until they reach several hundred degrees Celsius so they're really not something you want to put on your fries because your food would immediately catch explosion pardon fire but these salts they're a good heat source so when the demand for electricity increases the heat from the salt can be transferred to water to make Steam turn turbines and generate the electricity we need it seems simple and existing fossil fuel plants could even be repurposed to contain thermal storage and steam generators except molten salt also has a bad habit of corroding everything it touches and fighting that is a constant expensive battle so is keeping the salt hot enough to stay liquid especially if you want to do that with renewable energy as great as they are renewable energy sources like wind or solar just don't have a high energy density compared to fossil fuels in other words to generate the same amount of energy as a fossil fuel power plant using solar panels you'd need anywhere from 25 to 2 000 times as much space compared to fossil fuels all these storage options can have a high green premium or upfront cost difference so there is one more path we start sharing buckets across locations even time zones in other words instead of saving spare electricity for when we need it we could transmit that electricity to somewhere that needs it right now connecting grids over wider areas would allow utility companies to deliver electricity more efficiently and more equitably and it could overcome some of the limitations with renewable energy one region that's super Sunny could send power to a city that's a bit more overcast this is Seattle hey Phoenix unfortunately this is hard with the grids we have at the moment our buckets only serve certain regions unless you happen to be near Indianapolis right now my Region's electricity bucket not connected to yours but this is starting to change for instance the trans-west Express in the U.S say that three times fast is planning to take wind power from Wyoming and deliver it all the way to California over a thousand kilometers away big Regional projects like this will help each state reduce its emissions while requiring fewer solar panels and wind turbines than if each state powered itself alone you know what they say teamwork Makes the Dream Work in the end decarbonizing electricity won't have a single solution like filling part of the Sahara with solar panels I mean if transmitting electricity between states is hard right now imagine the challenge of transmitting electricity from one part of Africa to the rest of the world and that's not even mentioning how we'd store it so obviously collaboration will be key here some regions might work on advancing batteries While others might focus on connecting grids and you you might contribute to research or policy or Tech that furthers the conversation in areas you're interested in figuring out the best ways to store and transmit electricity won't be easy but the payoffs will be huge because whatever strategy we come up with won't just help us make carbon free electricity the advancements will affect all other big carbon emitting sectors like Transportation or heating our homes we'll get into that next time special thanks to Harry brison this episode's combination bucket manager wind turbine Wrangler and duck curve illustrator you really held it down this

    "content": "Hi! I'm Stan Muller, this is Crash Course World History, and today we're going to talk about energy. I don't mean crystal energy or pyramid power or even Red Bull. I mean the energy that humans use to build pyramids or synthesize crystals or to manufacture energy drinks. Hey, hey! Where's Mr. Green? Mr. Green is out today and I am the substitute. A sub? Can we watch a video? This is a video. [Theme Music] So today we're going to talk about Children of the Sun by Alfred Crosby who you might remember from our episode on the Columbian Exchange. This is Crosby's book about energy and in it he says: \"Modern civilization is the product of an\nenergy binge... but humankind's unappeasable appetite for energy makes the solutions ephemeral and the challenge permanent.\" which is not that hopeful. But before we start looking at the history\nof human energy use, let's talk about what we mean by energy. For our purposes here, energy is the power to do work. For more than 99% of human history, the main source of energy to do work was muscle, either human or animal. And the fuel for that muscle was food, usually plants, and plants ultimately get their energy from the sun. So, almost all the energy that humans use\ncomes from the sun in one way or another. Hence the book's title, Children of the Sun. Humans are a lot of things, but efficient\nenergy converters isn't one of them. That's why you need a lot of humans to do a lot of work. It took a lot of power to build the pyramids, for example, and it couldn't have happened without some technological advances using energy. The first great energy technology was fire.\nIt enabled us to cook which gave us a greater variety of available food and thus more fuel for our muscles. Fire also led to metal work and improvements in tools. Another notable advance in energy was the domestication of plants and animals. By domesticating plants, humans redirected the sun's energy to create more nutritious and energy-producing food. The sun also indirectly fueled domesticated animals like horses and oxen, which were harnessed to do even more useful work. After the invention of agriculture, developments in human energy kind of plateaued for a while. The only energy that we had that didn't derive from the sun was water power, since wind technically comes from the sun's heating the air so sailing ships and wind mills are kind of solar power. There were some minor advances, like concentrating the energy density of wood by converting it to charcoal, and adding oxygen to fires using bellows, but for the most part, power was still generated by muscle. The next big change in energy use came with industrialization. Let's go to The Thought Bubble. So industrialization utilized new forms of fuel in coal, and later oil and natural gas. These fuels are just really, really old forms of fossilized plant and animal matter, so again, they're originally from the sun, but we don't think of it this way. Nobody calls coal \"solar power.\" While the Chinese were using coal during the Song Dynasty to work iron, for example, England was where coal use really took off, thanks to the steam engine. Newcomen's Steam Engine was, according to Crosby, \"The first machine to provide significantly large amounts of power not derived from muscle, water, or wind.\" Coal powered industrialization was a pretty big deal. It allowed Britain to dominate the textile industry, and industrially produced weapons, and steam powered ships enabled Europeans to penetrate and dominate Africa, and parts of Asia. According to Crosby, fossil fuels \"created the political and economic landscape we recognize today.\" After steam powered manufacturing, it was a short chronological leap to electricity, which was used to power machines, and for illumination. Electric light was a really big deal because it provided a clean and efficient way to allow people to work after dark. Thanks, Thought Bubble. Although we might think of coal as the fuel of the 19th century,  we still use a lot of it today. Especially for generating electricity, but coal is much less efficient than oil. Oil was revolutionary because it could power not only electricity plants, and ships, and trains, but also the internal combustion engine, which makes cars and trucks possible. Crosby maintains that \"the internal combustion engine powering the automobile, truck, and tractor has for a century been the most influential contrivance on the planet.\" By the end of the 20th century, there were\nhalf a billion cars in the world, and humans were using 70 million barrels of oil each day. Manufacturing and driving all those cars has had a huge impact on the environment. From an energy use perspective, the world since 1900 is a totally new era in human history. We use electricity for everything in the West. It powers our gadgets, it lights our homes, it gets us around on trains, or buses, or cars. Crosby puts it like this: \"Humanity's primary energy use has increased twenty times over since 1850 and nearly five times over since 1950.\" In the U.S., each individual consumed 2000 kilowatt hours of electricity in 1950, and 32,700 in 2000. Oil and natural gas are the most important fuels for this electricity boom, although as of 2006, 40%-50% of humans, most of them living in the tropics, still rely on wood for fuel. So, when the world will run out of oil is a topic of heated debate, but scientists have been looking for other forms of fuel for decades. One alternative is nuclear power, which has not been a total success. The first nuclear plant providing power for homes opened in the Soviet Union in 1954, and some countries, notably France, still rely heavily on nuclear energy. Despite initial enthusiasm from scientists,\nand science fiction writers, nuclear power never caught on in the U.S. partly because it's really expensive. Another problem is that no one can figure out what to do with the radioactive waste that nuclear energy produces. But the biggest reason nuclear power fails to catch on is because people think nuclear power is dangerous, believing that nuclear plants can easily turn into huge bombs, or that malfunctioning reactor cores will melt all the way through the earth to China, or something. Actually, it would probably melt all the way through to Australia or something, but you know what I mean. Nuclear accidents have happened, though, notably and Windscale in England in 1957, and at San Loren in France in 1969, but neither of these was catastrophic. The U.S. had a nuclear scare in 1979 with and accident at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania. Although there were no immediate casualties, thousands of people in the vicinity were forced to evacuate, and the cleanup took years, and cost millions. The disaster at the Soviet nuclear plant at\nChernobyl in 1986 was much worse, with a release of radiation that was hundreds of times greater than that given off at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and fallout that will be lethal for 24,000 years. A few countries still use nuclear power, but it never really caught on. Overall, nuclear power has never accounted for more than 5% of the world's energy supply. In recent years, rising concerns over climate change have led to increased calls for humanity to find cleaner, more renewable forms of energy. The alternative, that we significantly reduce our energy consumption, seems unlikely, especially since it would seem like a historical step backward. History is often presented as a story of progress and growth and increasing complexity and a future in which we use is kind of hard to imagine. But historically speaking, the world we live in is new, it's unsustainable, and it's not normal. Crosby offers us this reminder \"Most of us in the richer societies can only recall times of immediate access to abundant energy. That abundance tempts us, successfully, to believe that having energy flow down lines from far away and illuminate our rooms when we flip the switch is normal rather than miraculous.\" In the end, how we reconcile our desire to continue our history of growth and rising complexity with the fact that such growth is unsustainable with current technology is one of the biggest challenges facing humanity today. Whether and how we rise to that challenge will determine what kind of world we live in tomorrow. Thanks for watching, we'll see you next time.

    "content": "Sometimes, in the history of engineering,\nphysicists make their way into the story. Consider, for example: John Bardeen. You might not have heard of him, but Bardeen\nis the only person in all of history to win\nthe Nobel Prize in Physics twice. He shared the prize once in 1956 and again\nin 1972. Both times, he was involved in discoveries\nthat made clever use of materials for electrical\nengineering. The first prize was for his work on the\ndevelopment of the transistor, and the second was for describing a way to\nallow certain materials to conduct electricity with\nno resistance, called superconductivity. Superconductivity is tricky to achieve, but\nit might allow us transport electricity with\nnearly perfect efficiency in the future. Transistors, meanwhile, are electrical components\nthat have already revolutionized society. They form the basis of all modern computing. And at their heart are semiconductors. [Theme Music] As the name implies, semiconductors are in\nbetween materials that conduct electricity\nand materials that are totally non-conducting. A classic example would be silicon, which\nis so commonly used as a semiconductor that\nSilicon Valley was named after it. As we’ll see, semiconductors have been transforming\nthe face of technology for decades. On its own, silicon doesn’t conduct electricity\nvery well. It has no free charges, like free electrons,\nin it to carry a current. But you can alter the structure of silicon\non an atomic level to change that. First, you replace a few of the atoms in a\nlayer of silicon with phosphorus atoms. Those phosphorus atoms each carry one more\nelectron than a silicon atom would have, which introduces more negatively-charged\nelectrons into the material. Those extra electrons aren’t bound to any\nof the silicon atoms and are therefore free,\nnegative charges. For that reason, we call this an N-type semiconductor\n– “N” for negative. On the other hand, if you switch some of the\nsilicon atoms with boron atoms, it creates a\nrelative lack of electrons in the material. The boron atom has one less outer electron\nthan the silicon atom it’s replacing. The places where those electrons are absent\nare called holes. The lack of negative charge creates regions of\nfree positive charge, so we call this arrangement\na P-type semiconductor. Holes can move around and be transported\nin a material, just like the absence of water in a\nsealed container – a level, for example – forms a bubble whose location you can\nkeep track of. You can think of holes as effectively “positive charges”\nthat can be filled by the presence of an electron. When that happens, the space left behind by\nthat electron creates a new hole. Now, on their own, those P- and N-type semiconductors\naren’t all that exciting. Unlike pure silicon, which is an insulator,\nthey’ll be weakly conducting because they now\nhave free charges moving around. But things get really interesting when you put\nthem together – like if you have both P and N type \nconductors sandwiched together in a circuit. Normally in electrical circuits, the electrons\nflow from the negative terminal to the positive. Remember that the current is defined to flow\nin the opposite direction, so it travels from\npositive to negative. One thing you can do by sandwiching both\ntypes of semiconductors is to stop the current\nin a circuit from flowing altogether. If you put the N-type semiconductor on the positive\nterminal side, and the P-type semiconductor on the\nnegative terminal side, together they stop the current, even though on their own, they’d each be\nweakly conductive. It works because each semiconductor’s extra\ncharges are the opposite of the terminal it’s next to. All the negatively charged electrons in the\nN type semiconductor are drawn towards the\npositive terminal of the circuit. And all the holes in the P type semiconductor are\ndrawn to the negative terminal of the cell. Since the effective charges are being pulled\naway from the area between the semiconductors, you end up with a gap between the two plates\nwhere charge can’t be transported across,\ncalled a depleted region. Since there are no free charges to transport\na current across that gap, an electrical current\ncan’t pass through it. So if you arrange P- and N-type semiconductors\nthis way around, you can stop a flow of current. But, if you arrange them the other way around,\nwith the P-type near the positive terminal and the\nN-type near the negative terminal, now the electrons and the holes are drawn\ntowards each other. In this case, the extra electrons from the\nN-type fill the holes in the P-type, and the new\nholes spring up where the electrons used to be. This kind of cascade can happen throughout\nthe entire circuit, again and again until you have\nelectrons flowing much as before. In other words, in this arrangement the\ncurrent can now travel through where the N\nand P layers meet. The purpose of N and P type semiconductors put\ntogether is the simplest form of what we call a diode,\nwhich is basically a one-way enforcer of electrical current. It allows current to flow in one direction,\nbut stops it from flowing in the opposite\ndirection. It just depends on how you insert the semiconductors\nrelative to the terminals of your voltage supply – whether that’s a battery, an\nelectrical outlet, or something else. Being able to control the flow of a current\ncan be really useful. For example, you might have an alternating\ncurrent, or AC signal flowing through a circuit, where the direction of the current changes\nback and forth. But many electrical components need a direct\ncurrent, or DC, with a flow of current in only one\ndirection. In the right arrangement, diodes can be used\nto convert a wavy, AC current into nice simple\nDC current. The flow of charge in the DC part of the current\nalways goes the same way, and the positive and negative ends of the\noutput remain the same, like a battery. So, diodes are handy for controlling the direction\nof a current. But you can do even more if you put three\nsemiconductors together in a sandwich. You have two options for this type of sandwich:\nP-N-P, or N-P-N. In both cases, the middle layer effectively\ncreates a diode with each of the outer layers, with each diode allowing current to flow in\nthe opposite direction. This may not sound terribly useful, because\ntogether, the three semiconductor layers are\nrestricting flow both ways. Unless, that is, you add a second current. Let’s say you have an N-P-N sandwich connected\nto a battery. The current can’t flow through it, because\nyou have a positive terminal hooked up to\nan N layer. The electrons in that layer will be attracted\nto the positive terminal, while the holes in the\nP layer are attracted to the other N layer. So you end up with a depleted region between\nthem, and the current is going nowhere. But here’s the incredible thing. If you apply just a small current that flows\nfrom the middle plate to the N layer on the same\nside as the first battery’s negative terminal, the electrons moving into the P layer fill the\ndepleted region between it and the other N layer. So that gap the electrons couldn’t cross\nbefore disappears, and the original larger current\nis free to flow across the whole sandwich. In other words, you’ve created an electrical switch\n– a sort of gateway – that requires just a tiny current\nto control the flow of a larger current. And it works for P-N-P arrangements, too. This arrangement of semiconductors, that might\nseem so functionless at first, is a transistor. And the fact that it allows you to control how\ncurrent flows in a circuit makes it one of the most\nimportant components of the electronic age. Since transistors use smaller currents to\ninfluence the on or off states of the larger\ncurrents flowing through the wire, they form the basis of the binary system of\n1s and 0s that computers rely on. All the marvels of computers and computer\nchips, including your ability to watch this video, depend on semiconductors and the transistors\nwe make from them! So, that’s how materials like semiconductors\ncan direct the flow of electrical power. But semiconductors can be used to generate\nelectrical currents, too! And that ability has allowed us to take\nadvantage of an incredibly useful source of clean,\nrenewable energy. To see how this works, let’s go back to\na simpler diode set up, with a P-type and\nN-type semiconductor put together. This time, you don’t connect the two sides\nto a power supply. Instead, you attach it to a device you want\nto power, like a small electrical motor. Remember, the N-type will have an abundance\nof free negative charges and the P-type will\nhave an abundance of free holes. There’s no voltage being applied across the\njunction between the two types, so the electrons of\nthe N-type will naturally fill the holes in the P-type. This creates a depleted region at the interface\nbetween the two semiconductors. There are no free charges because the electrons\nbecome weakly bound to atoms when they fill\nthe holes that were in the P-type. The N-type has a small region with some positively\ncharged atoms from the absence of those electrons, while the P-type has a small region with some\nnegative charge from those extra electrons\nit picked up. These opposite charges set up an electric\nfield across the gap. If there were any free electrons in this field, they’d be\ndriven away from the negatively charged region in the P-\ntype, towards the positive region set up in the N-type. So that’s our setup. Now, how do you get energy from this? On its own, it’s not going to do an awful\nlot. But electrons in a material can respond to\nlight. When light hits them, the electrons interact\nwith the light and can even absorb some of\nits energy. If the bound electrons in the P-type absorb\nenergy from the light shining on the material, they can get just enough energy to stop being\nbound to atoms and become free charges! Remember that the charges across the gap set\nup an electric field. Electric fields apply a force to free electric\ncharges, so an electron freed from the extra\nenergy it got from the light is now driven\nby that electric field into the N-type. That leaves a hole in the P-type waiting to\nbe filled, but the electrons can’t flow back against the\nelectric field; the forces push it the other way around. Instead, the N-type’s extra electron will\nflow all the way around the circuit, through\nthe device, delivering electrical power. That’s a solar cell! With the right arrangement of semiconductors,\nit allows you to generate electricity from light. These kinds of cells are exactly what form\nthe basis of solar panels. With semiconductors, and silicon in particular,\nyou can create electrical power from sunlight. And I think you’ll agree, that’s a pretty\nbright idea. In this episode, we looked at silicon, and\nhow introducing small amounts of other elements allow silicon layers to conduct currents,\nturning them into semiconductors. We saw how putting two different types – N and P\nsemiconductors – together gave us electrical\ncomponents like diodes, transistors, and solar cells. Next on our tour of materials engineering,\nwe’ll be going super tiny as we explore\nthe world of nanomaterials. Crash Course Engineering is produced in association\nwith PBS Digital Studios.

    "content": "from 2010 to 2015 the raheen state in Myanmar was pummeled by severe weather events Cyclone swept through in 2010 floods destroyed about 1.7 million tons of rice in 2011 making scarce a primary staple of the country's diet and in 2015 there was even more serious flooding events like these are becoming more frequent and more severe because of climate change but they don't affect everyone equally in raheen a group called The rohingya were some of the hardest hit and not just by the floods the rohingya are Muslims in a Buddhist majority State and they had been discriminated against by the government for decades when these storms made resources scarce instead of being seen as neighbors the rohingya were seen as competitors this fueled violence and deepened inequalities against the rohingya since 2017 nearly a million have fled their homes and become refugees to be clear climate change denot on its own cause this violence people did if we could remove people from climate change and just think about how greenhouse gases are trapping more heat well that would be a lot simpler what is complex about climate change is well us because when the effects of climate change impact communities all around the world those impacts layer right on top of pre-existing cultural political and economic contexts hi I'm M Jackson and this is Crash Course climate and energy [Music] when you hear scientists talk about climate change you'll often hear us mention increasing amounts of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and that's a helpful metric it's something we can measure and track as time goes on to get a sense of how the planet is doing but on their own the numbers don't tell us how our lives will be impacted I mean sure there are more than 400 molecules of carbon dioxide out there for every million air molecules but what I want to know is if my air conditioner can handle the next Heat Wave or if my grandma in Florida is going to face another category 5 hurricane this year and you you probably have your own questions like that maybe our grandmas or even pool Buddies the key is climate change is about more than just molecules in the air it's about our ability to respond and adapt to our changing world like whether we can afford a new AC unit or if Grandma's health will let her drive Inland before a storm these are things shaped more by Society than by climate change and right now we live in an unequal world the carbon dioxide molecules bopping around might be emotionless and bias free but our systems and societies aren't we live in a world where different societies value different people differently for unfair and unjust reasons racism and extreme inequality remain common which means some groups are supported less by their society and as a result have been and will be disproportionately affected by climate change it also means they have fewer resources to adapt to it climate change isn't just an environmental or a humanitarian crisis it's a crisis of Justice regardless of wealth race nationality or level of status in a society people's environments should be clean hell healthy and sustainable that's what people are talking about when they say environmental justice environmental justice covers a whole range of environmental issues like water quality and air pollution but it also includes climate Justice climate Justice is the idea that the challenges we're facing as our climate changes shouldn't affect any one Community more than others even though those physical impacts are different around the world one example the poles are warming faster than the Equator so communities across the Arctic are experiencing Vanishing sea ice and land ice melting Tundras and severe storm events climate Justice proposes that these communities should have the power to improve their situations and they should be able to get the support they need to adapt since environmental and climate injustices overlap focusing on one helps the other take a coal-fired power plant for instance it releases all kinds of carbon emissions that contribute to climate change so climate Justice would see that plant replaced with carbon-free renewable energy sources but build on that coal plants have been historically placed within low-income communities and neighborhoods of color often because these communities have less time and fewer resources to Lobby against them that means the air pollution from burning coal and the contaminated water from dumped waste directly affects those communities increasing risks of cancer driving down real estate prices and much more so climate Justice says both retire the coal burning power plant and involve the impacted Community to help equitably replace it with wind and solar the result you improve local air and water quality and empower the surrounding Community but climate and Justice in particular goes Way Beyond local power plants it's experienced all over the world you know how when you go out to eat with your friends you usually split the bill based on who ordered what so if your friend got a five dollar bowl of soup and you got the jumbo seafood platter you're probably not going to split the bill 50 50. that would be fair right well at the moment climate change isn't fair wealthy economically developed countries have emitted the majority of the CO2 in the atmosphere and they're typically better able to adapt lower income Nations contribute far fewer emissions but are much more susceptible to the effects of climate change and are less able to adapt for example a flash flood in the U.S could cause serious damage but a flash flood in Bangladesh could cause serious damage and upset water systems and cause a cholera outbreak and there might not be enough resources to replace lost crops so the risks lower income communities face are more multiplied these communities didn't order the proverbial seafood platter it wasn't even on their menu but they're being hit with the bill meanwhile in wealthier parts of the world everyone just keeps ordering more seafood and on top of that so long as someone else's pain throwing in fancy desserts this kind of Injustice can't be dismissed as purely accidental it's not an error on a restaurant receipt and it's not just present between different parts of the world Injustice within countries is also extremely common and sometimes is the result of legal unequal treatment that continues to have consequences even after the laws themselves have been corrected to see how this can play out let's head to the thought bubble in the United States in the middle of the 20th century people from marginalized groups and especially black people were discriminated against by wide sectors of society including Banks and insurance companies this discrimination made it difficult to buy homes among other things these practices led to redlining where Maps were drawn in towns and cities to concentrate marginalized commune communities into isolated often undesirable and under-resourced neighborhoods red bunny was banned in 1968 but its Legacy continues to negatively impact many towns and cities across the U.S formerly Redline neighborhoods are more likely to be heavily built up with tall buildings and cement surfaces that absorb heat and not much Greenery to help them cool down as such these neighborhoods have become some of the hottest places in the country on average historically redlined areas are about 2.5 degrees Celsius hotter than other neighborhoods in the same city and in the summer they can be more than 10 degrees hotter also since highways and Industry are often intentionally built within redlined areas air pollution affects these predominantly black neighborhoods more than others leading to higher rates of asthma and other health impacts add that to the fact that black communities typically have poorer Access to Health Care due to the legacy of racist policies and practices throughout the medical system an environmental Injustice becomes a question of life and death even in one of the richest countries in the world so formerly Redline neighborhoods today are becoming literal hot spots for environmental and climate Justice advocacy as people work to dismantle unjust legacies thanks thought bubble not every Injustice is quite so overt sometimes policies with unequal impacts are more subtle or they're the result of well-intentioned but under-informed decision making a storm happening now is connected to a policy that may have been outlawed decades ago and if fossil fuels that started being released hundreds of years ago in a place far away and it's worthwhile to try to untangle all of this because there are all kinds of unexpected and unequal effects of climate change that we can better address when all the cards are on the table for instance due to a variety of cultural contexts that privilege men women girls and those across the gender Spectrum are more likely to feel the sting of climate change this is especially true in rural areas and lower income countries where women don't have the same freedoms and job opportunities as men and are less likely to own land or have access to resources to cope with disasters indigenous communities as a whole also face extreme environmental Injustice worldwide there's some of the strongest advocates for the environment and are responsible for protecting some 20 percent of the Earth's surface and some 80 percent of its biodiversity but indigenous people are often harmed by discriminatory policies that don't Factor them in even as the environment changes around them and as their homes and lands degrade they can be left impoverished and without the power to change their situation and this story it begins with the unjust practices of colonizing indigenous people's lands and continues to this day when injustices are combined with the increasing risks of Hazards like floods storms and heat waves in our warming world that can lead to catastrophe for example the 2011 monsoon season in Thailand caused deadly flooding the rain started early and multiple tropical storms drenched the country and impacted millions of people but when the flooding began the government focused on protecting the higher income capital so while there was damage in the Capital Area it dodged the worst case scenario however lower income communities outside the capital were unsupported and underwater for as long as three months the flooding in those communities was actually made worse because of all the water being diverted away from the capital the humanitarian crises during extreme events like this have led some experts to suggest that there's no such thing as a natural disaster they're not saying tropical storms don't exist instead what they're saying is a storm chilling in the middle of the ocean isn't a disaster that's a natural weather event it only becomes a disaster when it makes landfall and impacts communities and when societal inequity limits the resources available to protect people against these storms and communities are devastated as a result that's a human-caused disaster environmental and climate Justice are about more than just responding to disaster though people companies and governments making decisions aren't taking inequalities into account even trying to slow and prevent climate change can have negative effects for instance making a huge number of batteries solar panels and wind turbines to power a renewable energy grid is going to be great for the climate but requires raw materials that have to come from somewhere multinational companies often mine these materials in lower income countries like Chile Mexico and the Democratic Republic of Congo and that's not because those are the only places these minerals exist it's because that's where they can be produced cheaply and with fewer regulations allowing these companies to sidestep responsibility for the environmental impacts local communities face as a result of the mining so if we don't move forward with attention to patterns and histories of inequality both globally and within our own communities we risk repeating many of the same mistakes all over again climate change is about more than just molecules and gases it's also about you and me and our billions of neighbors and all the weird terrible and sometimes wonderful stuff that comes with us the encouraging thing is environmental justice Advocates so many passionate people have been and are working now to address these inequalities sometimes this looks like communities planting trees in their concrete heavy neighborhoods harmed by redlining and other times this looks like policy makers folding issues of climate Justice into their National or even International priorities we'll get more into those policies in the next episode Special thanks to Kelsey Warren our grandma for this episode we'll make sure to visit you in

    "content": "in a typical year humans are pumping about 51 billion tons of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere at least that's what's typical at the time we're making this episode in 2022. It's tricky to imagine what a billion tons of anything looks like but to give you a sense of scale this is equivalent to about 8 500 Great Pyramids of Giza or 150 000 empire state buildings but carbon dioxide is a lot more Airy than your average Egyptian pyramid so our emissions take up quite a bit more space every year that massive gas amounts to about 26 quadrillion liters enough to fill up the Grand Canyon six times over the carbon dioxide we're pumping into the atmosphere is causing unprecedented climate change but why do we release so much carbon into the atmosphere and how easy will it be to change our ways hi hi I'm M Jackson and this is Crash Course climate energy [Music] in the latter half of the 18th century Scottish engineer James Watt made some improvements to the design of a coal-powered steam engine he hoped that his new engine would make it more efficient to pump water out of the bottom of deep coal mites but it ended up doing a lot more than that watt developed the first modern steam engine and it set us on the course for the Industrial Revolution after a couple hundred thousand years of doing things by hand or with animals in just a few decades we switched to doing pretty much everything with the help of machines this transition ultimately relied on energy-rich fuels specifically coal oil and natural gas these collectively are known as fossil fuels because they form much like fossils do the story of fossil fuels goes like this once upon a time some plants are algae dyed as they tend to but instead of decaying away their carbon-rich bodies were trapped inside sediments that later became Rock then over millions of years those rocks were heated and squeezed by geologic processes transforming the remnants of those plants and algae into huge unrecognizable reservoirs of carbon-rich material imagine a disgusting underground soup and today when you fire up your gas stove for mac and cheese or hop on a bus some of that prehistoric material is burned to power your life take that in for a second on a daily basis you're interacting with matter that's older than dinosaurs RAR you're just the latest in a long line of humans to tap into these res bars we've been using fossil carbon as a fuel source since as early as Roman times when coal was used to heat public baths that's because fossil fuels are much more energy dense than the Alternatives meaning they pack a lot more bang for their Buck than things like wood or charcoal around the mid 1700s when Engineers figured out how to use all that bang to make our lives easier things got really interesting the key was to transform the chemical energy tied up in fossil fuels into mechanical energy that could physically move and power machines for example engines do this by burning fuel to turn chemical energy into heat energy that heat energy is then used to boil water and make Steam which is trapped in a pressurized container but as that steam is released it has the power to push a piston or turn a turbine creating movement that can power a pump a wheel deal or the entire Industrial Revolution that new technology transformed manufacturing agriculture Transportation making it all faster and more efficient fundamentally reshaping the way we live work and play and now these fuels are everywhere coal is burned in power plants diesel runs trucks and trains natural gas Heats homes and businesses and fossil fuels are even processed to make plastic used in everything from your toothbrush to your smartphone and after seeing how powerful these fuels could be governments made policies to encourage their use and keep them affordable but this 260-year love affair with fossilized carbon has come at Great cost burning these fuels releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and over time that gas is built up now it's helping to trap heat close to Earth's surface via the greenhouse effect causing the planet to warm and the climate to change at an unprecedented rate if we want to slow that rate and reduce the impacts of climate change we need to stop leasing so much carbon dioxide and that means it's time to break up with fossil fuels but even that won't be easy in fact it's probably going to be one of the messiest breakups of all time almost as messy as when Dean left Rory in the middle of the Stars Hollow dance Marathon I'm sorry I just get emotional every time pretty much everything we do ends up releasing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere our carbon emitting habits can be broken down in a number of different ways if you break out yield Google to try to figure out which large-scale human activities contribute to climate change the most you'll usually find variations of roughly the same five categories industry or manufacturing Transportation electricity energy use and commercial or residential buildings AKA heating or Cooling and then agriculture but then you'll be like wait what because across different sources you'll see different sized slices representing how much each of these sectors actually contribute to the global emissions pie that's because well everything is kind of connected for example we release greenhouse gases when driving our cars but we also release them when refining the oil into the fuel they use or when producing the steel they're made of so it depends on whether a source is counting all those emissions towards the transportation slice of the pie or if it's counting the steel production and oil refining Parts in a separate manufacturing slice for this series we usually do the latter try to separate energy that's used for the purpose of making stuff from the energy that's used for the purpose of getting around and by that count make Keen stuff is the biggest category post-industrial materials like steel concrete and plastic all have to be heavily processed and we use so much of them that they account for around 30 percent of global Greenhouse emissions annually next accounting for about 26 percent of global emissions is our thirst for electricity lights appliances industrial Machinery the internet all rely on a constant flow of electricity two-thirds of which is still generated by fossil fuels meanwhile 21 of our emissions come from growing things the agricultural industry is responsible for the plants and animals we eat and the plants and animals they eat and the plants we grow for other purposes like clothes and paper and although plants do take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere they are outmatched by the land clearance involved in agriculture and even more so by fertilizers and Machinery that rely heavily on fossil fuels are we there yet not quite we've still got the transportation industry which is responsible for about 16 of global emissions that includes 1 billion passenger Cars Plus planes trucks trains and ships in the global trade and transport Network and finally seven percent of emissions come from Heating and Cooling our buildings the point is fossil fuel use and greenhouse gas emissions are inescapable to some degree they're entangled in so many more stages of so many more of our modern systems than we often stop to think about the bright side if we can learn to decarbonize our energy sources it will have impact across all of these industries and more take something as simple as ordering a new cotton t-shirt from an online retailer which we'll do in the thought bubble by ordering online one less physical storefront needs to be built lit or heated so that's a start but your computer and internet do rely on consistent electricity which releases greenhouse gases also the T-shirt you ordered is made from cotton which was grown on land that's cleared of its natural vegetation plus fertilized planted and harvested to do any of that planting fertilizing and harvesting you need processes and equipment and then at the factory you're sure to spun sewn and packaged with the help of Steel machinery and plastic materials in an Ideal World the factory and storage warehouses will also be cooled and heated to keep workers at a comfortable temperature finally when it's ready the T-shirt will be shipped to your door via cargo ship plane or track and with all of these steps more greenhouse gases then if you ship the shirt back because you got the wrong size or don't like the color even more gases are emitted it doesn't end there either in a few years when your T-shirt or your amazing Fringe jacket goes out of style they'll end up in a landfill while they'll slowly decompose releasing greenhouse gases long after you've forgotten about them thanks stop bubble I lost this it's a keeper all in all the fashion industry releases the equivalent of roughly a billion metric tons of carbon dioxide every year hearing stories like this I know can make you feel kind of guilty I released all those greenhouse gases and all I got was this lousy t-shirt or Fringe jacket and while it can make an impact to shop second hand what this story shows us is how climate change is simultaneously about you and so much more than you altering the systems involved in fast fashion which operate on a global scale will require massive human collaboration and of course it's not just about fashion when you add up emission sources from Industries all around the world it's not hard to see how we've made it to 51 billion tons of greenhouse gases per year and many of these industries put out a lot of good into the world including manufacturing and Industrial agriculture but if we stand any chance of reducing the greenhouse gases we put out we'll need to decarbonize every one of these major emission sectors that means finding a way to do these things without emitting carbon dioxide essentially we're talking about another Industrial Revolution to overhaul how we power Our Lives now some Industries will be easier to decarbonize than others for example the technology to decarbonize electricity is already getting there it's why you might see solar panels on the side of the highway or wind turbines in a field it's now a question of making this Tech affordable and accessible to everyone plus solving problems of storage and availability which we're going to talk about more in the next few episodes but other Industries will be a lot harder like the production of cement and concrete these materials are made by breaking up Limestone rock with heat a process which unavoidably releases carbon dioxide and we don't currently have an acceptable substitute for these materials an additional challenge is that emissions are a global problem that will need a global solution right now the amount of energy a country uses is very closely linked to its economic wealth for instance the Nations like the U.S Canada and the UK have strong modern economies that take a lot of energy to sustain but they can afford to invest in the infrastructure to make that happen so they're also more likely to have the cash to fund more expensive low-carbon Solutions but there are still some parts of the world that can't fund basic access to energy let alone low carbon solutions that means people can't light or cool their homes power appliances and computers or refrigerate food and medicines at the same time many of these countries populations are growing increasing the demand for energy even though the supply is unreliable more people also means we need more buildings which means we need more concrete and more steel except the cheapest and quickest way to get that energy and make those Building Supplies is to use tried and tested carbon heavy Technologies so many scholars and political leaders argue that the responsibility to decarbonize ultimately falls on the shoulders of those higher income countries this requires developing new materials new processes and new technologies to curtail greenhouse gas emissions when wealthy countries invest in decarbonized Technologies they become more efficient and less expensive for the rest of the world that could lead to a drop in emissions worldwide which would help reduce some of the effects of climate change but if you've ever tried to split the bill at a restaurant you know this is a complicated situation figuring out how much each country should be responsible for reducing emissions and who is accountable is an ongoing International challenge especially because the higher income countries that are best poised to lead the charge are the same ones that benefit the most from the fossil fuel-powered global economy and in general we humans have a really hard time accepting short-term economic losses in place of long-term environmental gain remember we are interacting daily with fossilized carbon from millions of years ago but we're often thinking in terms of the next few minutes the next election or in my case the next meal but this short-term vision and the short-term policies that sometimes go with it won't help us in the long run lower income countries will certainly feel the worst effects of climate change sooner but no one is immune to changes happening on a global level after all we're all on the same Earth overall scientists agree that we have to do something and soon this won't be easy and it certainly won't happen overnight but we have to start somewhere and to help address nearly a third of all of our emissions decarbonizing electricity might be the first step but we'll get more into that in the next episode Special thanks to Ben Massengale our steam engine conductor

    "content": "our ability to get to far away places fast is a Marvel Transportation allows us to share ideas see loved ones seek out all the cool cat cafes and Glacier museums even swap our best inventions so let's say I'm on an expedition to my favorite Glacier in Iceland and I forget my favorite jacket in just a few days I can have it shipped to me and I'll finally feel complete again but for as magical as that is transportation is also one of the most visible personal ways we're transforming the earth's climate cars ships and Planes release heat trapping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere every day which means that to decarbonize Transportation we'll have to take to the road the air and the Sea hi hi I'm M Jackson and this is Crash Course climate and energy [Music] when it comes to climate change it's easy to point fingers at Transportation if you have a car say your beat up Camry Hot Rod or hot rod Camry it's probably the most visible source of emissions in your life and transportation is an important piece of the emissions puzzle planes Cars cruise ships the whole industry transportation spews 8.2 billion tons of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere every year that's 16 of the around 51 billion tons we release annually and the fourth largest fossil fuel emitting industry and that's just the fuel required to power the vehicles that's not even including the fossil fuel emissions required to refine the oil before it gets to the pump or to produce the steel the cars are made of in the first place so it's not an insignificant slice of the gassy pie which gross by the way who wrote this almost half of the emissions from Transportation comes from personal vehicles the cars Vans motorcycles and SUVs we drive in our daily lives the other half comes from all the other vehicles cargo ships semi trucks planes buses and more transporting lots of stuff or people decarbonizing both Realms will mean fewer Greenhouse emissions and less pollution for the entire planet but decarbonizing transportation also has a second major benefit Beyond helping slow the global effects of climate change it could also be a step towards correcting environmental inequities things like air water and noise pollution that disproportionately affects some more than others for example many highways in the U.S have intentionally been built right through low-income communities that means the people who live there often people of color have had to Bear the brunt of transportation's air and water pollution and experience unjust physical and mental health outcomes as a result so decarbonizing the vehicles that drive by every day would have dual benefits it would lower carbon levels globally but could also be one step towards improving specific living environments that in many cases the residents didn't ask for wherever you live there is good news the first step to tackling decarbonization is clear and underway to decarbonize our rights we must first Electrify them and what we can Electrify we'll have to make is a efficient as possible and Supply with alternative fuels when it comes to personal Transportation you've probably seen electric vehicles in the Wild by this point instead of having to fuel up at a gas station they can plug in at homes or grocery stores or cat cafes and zoom from point A to point B on rechargeable batteries because they run on electricity these vehicles release fewer emissions and air pollutants than gas powered cars no matter where they're driven but an electric car is only as sustainable as the electricity it's plugged into that means a car charged on renewable electricity comes closer to zero emissions than one driven off of a coal burning power plant this is why carbon free electricity is such a big deal it's involved in decarbonizing all of our other Industries including how we get places the carbon free electricity isn't the main barrier to electric vehicles there are Bunches of reasons they're still not everywhere one is charging station access most electric cars can be plugged in at home with similar outlets in the garage to what your power tools use but if you drive long distances without a predictable place to plug in that's a problem globally more charging stations are being built every year especially in large cities but for electric vehicles to really take off there's a need for more charging infrastructure in more places especially rural areas governments and private entities have a role to play in promoting this by offering incentive even updating building codes on places like parking garages so that more spaces have electricity access another challenge though is the pesky Specter of the green premium the cost difference between low carbon Tech and the conventional carbon emitting choice for instance people in Europe and China have been quicker to adopt electric vehicles than people in the U.S in parts of Europe Sky High gas prices already match the cost of electric cars which means the green premium there is lower but in the US this hasn't always been the case in 2021 almost two-thirds of Americans saw electric cars were better for the environment but more expensive and only 40 percent said they would consider buying one but the cost to build electric cars has dropped as Government subsidies and cheaper batteries Drive prices down and the closer an electric cars upfront cost gets to its gas powered equivalent the easier it should be to afford plugging in over gassing up that said manufacturers have tended to focus on making luxury electric vehicles instead of affordable ones and the metals and batteries aren't always easy to come by not to mention the environmental impacts of mining those rare earth metals so although electrifying our rides is the end goal the journey there is probably not going to be one seamless Electric Slide into the sun's set I mean we hope it would be we'd love for that to be a big part of the choreography if not at least the grand finale but we'll probably need to learn some other dance moves along the way and one potential dance partner is government policy trust me they've got some moves even if they step on your toes Sometimes some countries are Banning the sale of petroleum-powered vehicles France plans to ban them by 2040 and the UK by 2030 and some countries offer cash rebates or tax incentives to electric car buyers but as we transition away from gas powered cars we'll likely still be sharing the road with them so another policy move is adjusting fuel economy standards basically requiring manufacturers to build more efficient cars which emit less carbon there's also congestion pricing where charging drivers a fee on high traffic roads the old discouraged driving reduce emissions trick but congestion pricing is most Equitable when people have alternative ways of getting where they need to go if we want to encourage people to drive less and reduce the half of Transportation emissions that come from personal vehicles we also have to design cities friendly to that with sidewalks bike lanes and robust public transit systems some surveys suggest that having good public transport and ride sharing Services can lead to as much as a 35 drop in car ownership and the emissions that come with it but designing cities that are truly friendly for everyone means leveraging the most powerful tool we've got people themselves let's head to the thought bubble Tulsa Oklahoma is a sprawling area of suburbs rural fringes and an urban core and it can be tough to get around without a car but it helps if you've got a 12 meter bus that's what the Indian nation's Council of governments enlisted when tasked with bettering Tulsa's public transportation also known as incog they're a mix of tribal and local governments and instead of holding your traditional City meeting to try and improve public transport they took to the streets and turned a bus into a mobile Outreach Center outfitted with interactive screens and displays the bus spent four months driving all over the city and anyone on board could talk to Transportation planners learn about public transit possibilities and weigh in on what should happen next no one had to come downtown for a formal meeting on a busy weeknight the conversation came to them by the end of the tour the bus had reached 2 000 citizens most of whom had never had a voice in transportation planning before and as a result incog was able to identify 16 places in Tulsa or bus routes or most needed and a couple years later a separate project also had locals identify places that weren't inviting on foot like busy roads without sidewalks when citizens get left out of these conversations you can end up with public transportation that doesn't serve the whole public or a city full of people in their personal vehicles by taking to the streets incog helped Tulsa more than just reduce future carbon emissions they helped the city make a plan that will create a cleaner more Equitable Community thanks thought bubble designing more walkable cities with more public transit would help reduce the way Transportation affects us and the planet especially while we work on decarbonizing personal vehicles it's a win for both environmental justice and Global carbon levels but then there's the other half of transportation's emissions the cogs in the rest of the global machine there's the bus I take to buy mac and cheese yes but there's also the fleet of semi trucks carrying mac and cheese around the country and the recycling truck hauling the Box away when I'm done then there's also the heavyweights the ships and airplanes that carry the powdered cheese and the noodles and the cardboard and me once I'm properly filled with mac and cheese when I'm off to Antarctica to check out a glacier the heavier the vehicle the harder it is to replace liquid fuels with electricity liquid petroleum packs a lot of energy into not much space to the point where the average lithium ion battery carries anywhere from 50 to 100 times less energy than an equivalent amount of gasoline and even the best batteries still have 35 times less energy per unit of weight what that actually tells us is to supply an already very heavy vehicle with enough power to drive a long time on a single charge you sacrifice cargo space and not a little space for example a diesel fuel truck can go over 600 kilometers on a single tank but for an electric truck to go the same distance on a single charge that truck would have to be mostly batteries with barely any Rim in the back for mac and cheese and a plane wouldn't even be able to get in the air the good news is batteries can still work for the lighter of these big vehicles like buses and garbage trucks that make short trips and have a consistent spot to charge every night now if you're interested in becoming a scientist or an engineer there are all kinds of opportunities to work on the next generation of batteries Tech that could help extend the range of electric vehicles lower the green premiums on them and help more consumers go electric or you can explore working on even newer Technologies to help the biggest vehicles for instance instead of diesel cargo ships could be filled with ammonia yeah the stuff in cat pee a colorless Renewable Fuel That packs 10 times more energy than the best batteries and for planes lithium air batteries which carry double the energy in the same amount of space could make some electric powered flights possible but for any of these Technologies to get Transportation off the ground we're going to need a lot more research funding so another route is to invest in research that lowers the green premium of drop-in fuels like we mentioned in episode 5 these lower carbon Alternatives can be substituted or dropped in to our current engines for example second generation biofuels can be made from non-edible farming byproducts such as corn stocks and electric fuels can be made by mixing hydrogen with carbon dioxide captured from industrial plants in a process powered by carbon-free electricity right now a big barrier is the cost difference between these newer drop-in fuels and the fossil fuels most vehicles are built to run on but invested in these substitutes is a good step in the lower emission direction we wouldn't need to modify heavy engines or build entirely new vehicles plus these fuels can be moved using tanks and pipelines we already have so decarbonizing transportation is complicated if it wasn't it likely would have already been done after all it's one thing to change how you move around it's another thing to change how lots of people or lots of stuff moves around so our best step is to Electrify as many vehicles as possible and where that isn't possible we need to explore alternatives to the energy dense fuels currently powering them it'll also be important to capture the carbon they emit to offset those emissions we can't yet avoid we'll dive more into those Solutions in our next episode Special thanks to Kyle and Amanda Fredrickson the dance

    "content": "Hey this is Henry from MinuteEarth NBC News & YouTube asked us to make a video\ngiving context for a question at the democratic presidential debate on January 17th, 2016. Most of you live all around the world and\nmay not have seen the debate. So without further ado, here’s the video\nand the response from the candidates. Hello from MinuteEarth - we’re scientists\nand writers who explore how things work on our planet. Fossil fuels have long kept our cars moving\nand our lightbulbs lit. But we now know that burning these fuels releases\nheat-trapping gases that are warming the planet, causing seas to rise, and contributing to\nextreme weather events like South Carolina’s devastating flooding last year. Fighting human-caused climate change means\ngiving up our global addiction to fossil fuels and shifting the bulk of the world’s energy\nsupply to alternative sources. Some countries have acted decisively to make\nthis transition, but here at home, we still get a whopping 82% of our energy from coal,\noil, and natural gas. In the US, political gridlock, pressure from\nindustry lobbyists, and insufficient R&D have made an already tough battle against climate\nchange even tougher So there  you go – if  you  want to see more, like  the  questions that a few other youtube creators\nasked the candidates, you can watch the whole debate at the NBC News youtube channel. Or click on the link in the description. And a HUGE thanks to our patreon supporters,\nwho make projects like this possible – this was a super last minute endeavor and we couldn’t\nafford to do it without your support. So thank you very much – And if you’d\nlike to support MinuteEarth, you can do so at Patreon.com/minuteearth"

    "content": "Hi, this is Kate from MinuteEarth, not to\nbe confused with 1985’s Hurricane Kate - only my parents can call me that. Anyway, in case\nyou weren’t tipped off by that disastrous intro, today, we’re bringing you four stories\nabout extreme weather, starting with this piping hot video. The earth has a lot of warm places: forest\nfires, lava floes, iron foundries, the inside of your toaster oven, nuclear reactors, and\nso forth. But, if we’re just talking about regular old sun-heats-the-earth climate and\nweather, where on the earth’s surface is hottest?\nSome might say “Death Valley,” which isn’t a bad guess, as the 56.7°Celsius temperature\nobserved a hundred years ago at aptly named Furnace Creek -- remains, according to official\nweather statistics, the highest temperature ever recorded.\nHowever, weather stations measure air temperature in the shade about a meter and a half above\nthe ground. And as you know if you’ve ever walked barefoot across a beach on a hot day,\nsurfaces in direct sunlight can be a lot hotter than the air just above them.\nPlus, there are only 11,119 official weather stations scattered across the globe, which\nequates to only 1 station every 13,000 square kilometers, or six on average for an area\nthe size of Scotland (not that Scotland is a leading candidate for heat waves). Super\nhot places like deserts are particularly harsh and remote, making weather stations impractical\nand even less common. So to find the true hottest place on earth,\nwe need an army of meteorology students to install and monitor thermometers on every\ninch of the planet. Or we could measure the the temperature of the earth from space...\nwhich NASA does, every day. The Terra and Aqua satellites carry instruments called spectroradiometers\nwhich detect the infrared radiation, that is, the heat, radiating from the Earth’s\nsurface. Their resolution isn’t amazing, since the satellites measure temperature averaged\nover each square kilometer of the globe, but that’s still 13,000 times better than weather\nstations. So, the winner for hottest square kilometer\non earth? Not Furnace Creek - it only clocked in at 62.7C. Not the “Scorched Wheat”\nplateau in the Lut Desert of Iran, despite repeated claims to be the hottest place on\nearth. However, it’s close - a nearby portion of the Lut Desert is the winner at 70.7C,\nor 159.3F. That’s one degree hotter than you need for the proteins in an egg yolk to\ncoagulate - that is, to cook. No need for your toaster oven - breakfast is served. That’s a hot day I don’t care to experience,\nbut that breakfast did look egg-cellent. Next up, a rising tide carries all boats, but the\nnews isn’t so good for those of us on land. Over the millennia, city dwellers have found\nlots of effective ways to protect themselves against invaders. But the forces of nature\nhave been harder to keep out, especially because most cities lie along coasts and major waterways.\nIn 1362, a storm aptly named “The Great Drowning of Men” wiped out a string of European\nsettlements, killing more than 25,000 people. In the centuries since, low-lying places like\nthe Netherlands have developed an impressive array of water-defense systems, including\nwierden, dikes, ditches, dams, locks, and picturesque water pumps. And in the mid-20th\ncentury, the Dutch began building an ambitious series of storm surge barriers that are among\nthe largest movable human-made objects in the world today.\nBut with sea levels projected to rise by as much as a meter in the next 90 years, and\nthree more meters in the following century, it’s clear that even the efforts of the\nDutch won’t be enough. Nor is the Netherlands alone: cities all over the world face similar\nthreats, not only from rising seas, but also from warming waters that are brewing stronger,\nscarier storms. Since keeping all this water out may simply\nnot be an option, people around the world are getting creative. Inventors in the U.K.\nhave created thirsty concrete capable of soaking up 600 liters of water per square meter EVERY\nminute and funneling it away. Dutch engineers are designing floating homes and shopping\ncenters that can bob along on rising seas. And who knows…the storm-driven waves that\nthreaten cities today might one day provide enough energy to power them.\nFloods of data are changing how cities deal with storms too, helping model where a storm\nis most likely to hit and visualizing where evacuations might need to occur.\nWe’ve also gone back to our roots. Salt marshes and mangroves in tidal zones can slow\nthe movement of incoming water, reducing wave heights and total wave energy by more than\n50%. Research shows that combining these natural features with engineered ones could avert\nhundreds of millions of dollars worth of storm damage in coastal urban neighborhoods such\nas New York’s Howard Beach. But so far, cities are far from fully storm-proofed;\nwe still need to gather more information and develop more solutions to make them as resilient\nas possible. It’s a good thing urban areas are innovative hotspots where great ideas\nare constantly flowing; they just need to flow out faster than the water can flow in. So we’re going to have to do a lot more\nto figure out how to keep our heads above water in the coming years. And speaking of\nwhich, if you’ve ever had to get flood insurance - or really almost any kind of insurance - you\nmay have heard the term “Acts of God”... but what does that actually mean? And what\ndoes butter have to do with anything? In 1903, an unprecedented flood struck Kansas,\nwreaking havoc on homes, farmland, infrastructure, and an entire trainload of butter. The creamery\nsued the rail company for its lost cargo, but the railroad argued that they shouldn’t\nbe responsible, since the flood had been completely out of their control. The court agreed, ruling\nthat the flood had been an “act of god.” Courts around the world have actually been\nusing the term since the 1500’s to describe unprecedented events that seem to come out\nof nowhere. Today, you’ll see “acts of god” mentioned in contracts, insurance policies,\nand a few US environmental laws. And, like in the butter case, you might hear a lawyer\nmilking the term as a defense in court. To use the “act of god” defense, you don’t\nhave to prove that a god actually caused the event, you just have to prove two things:\none, that taking reasonable precautions couldn’t have prevented the damage, and two, that the\ndamage was caused by a natural force with no human influence.\nBut it’s getting harder and harder to meet these criteria, starting with the reasonable\nprecautions. Thanks to improving technology and scientific knowledge, we’re increasingly\nable to predict the size, scope, and path of destructive events, which raises the bar\nfor what kind of “reasonable precautions” might be required to stave off damage. For\ninstance, back in 1903, the railway had put the butter car on what seemed like high enough\nground to keep it safe, but they had little way of knowing how severe the flood would\nbe. Today, with a lot more flood knowledge, they’d have to better prepare the butter\nfor the act of god defense to stick. And the second criteria is also harder to\nmeet because we’re finding that an increasing number of natural disasters do have human\nfingerprints on them. For instance, human activities have led to the warming and rising\nof the ocean, which almost certainly intensified Hurricane Sandy in 2012 and likely exacerbated\nEurope's 2015 heat wave. In fact, scientists estimate that some of Sandy’s catastrophic\neffects - like the flooding of vital transit tunnels, which added more than ten billion\ndollars of damage - might not have happened without the effects of human activity.\nSince natural events like floods, droughts, and wildfires are happening more often and\ndoing more damage than they used to, we may actually be seeing more Act of God cases pop\nup in court in the future. But because we’re becoming butter...I mean...better at predicting\nthose events – and recognizing our own contributions to them - the success of the act of god defense\nmay soon be relegated fully to the margarines. OK, no matter what you spread on your bread,\nwe can all probably agree that that ending pun could have been butter...uhh...better.\nBut one thing we can’t all agree on? How we experience extreme weather in the first\nplace. Take a look. Is the weather getting weirder? Your answer\nprobably depends on the weirdness of the weather you’ve been experiencing lately.\nFor example, after the U.K. got doused with one of its rainiest weeks on record, the Brits\nwho reported experiencing flooding were much more likely than their drier compatriots to\nsay they'd noticed wetter and wetter weather over the course of their lives. And before\na withering drought struck the American Midwest in 2012, only 41% of residents thought they\ndetected a long-term uptick in the frequency and intensity of dry spells – but after\nthat one dessicating summer, 66% said they’d been seeing worsening droughts for decades.\nRain or shine, our minds tend to prize their freshest impressions.\nBut even when we experience the same weird weather events as other people, we don’t\nalways agree on how weird they actually were. Data from more than 4000 meteorological stations\ntell us that the winter of 2012 was the third-warmest on record in the U.S. But according to the\nAmericans who lived through it...well, those who thought of global climate change as a\nserious, man-made threat were significantly more likely to report that their local winter\nweather had been warmer than usual. Even after adjusting for beliefs about global warming,\nthere was a political divide, with Democrats more likely than Republicans to rate the winter\nas unusually toasty. Clouding the issue further, these days we\nget less of our weather information first-hand and more from the media, where different channels\ncompete for our attention by mentioning “extreme weather” far more often than they used to\nand spicing up not-so-apocalyptic events with terms like ‘polar vortex’ and ‘snowmaggedon.’\nThe Weather Channel has even co-opted the World Meteorological Organization's practice\nof naming destructive tropical storms by christening every biggish snowstorm that trundles over\nNorth America. With so many sources of information, it’s\neasy for us to choose the ones that align with our broader worldviews, no matter what\nthey are. As a result, much of what we hear about the frequency of extreme weather can\nend up reinforcing whatever we already believe, rather than giving us new information about\nwhat's really going on. So, did this video tell you what you wanted\nto hear? And with that, I’m off to try to broaden\nmy worldview, come hell or high water. And finally, you may have noticed an alarming\ntrend among our stick figures: baldness. One hundred percent of stick figures inevitably\nend up bald...unless we take action with a few precisely-applied digital marker strokes.\nBaldness also affects real-life humans, too; according to this video’s sponsor, KEEPS,\nmore than ⅔ of non stick-figure men start losing their hair before the age of 35. If\nyou're a no-hair-don't-care kind of guy - awesome! You know we’re fans. But if you’re not\ninto the stick figure look, instead of curing male pattern baldness with a marker - which\ndoesn’t work nearly as well in real life as in our videos - you can at least partially\nprevent it with regular treatments of minoxidil - like the ones you can order from Keeps.\nAnd now, you can prevent both types of baldness. When you order a subscription at keeps.com/minuteearth,\nyou’ll not only get 50% off your first order, but we’ll also donate digital hair to an\notherwise cue-ball stick figure."

    "content": "Thanks to tiny differences in the swirls and\nwhorls of humans’ fingerprints, it’s possible to identify the specific person a set of fingerprints\nbelongs to. And we can do something similar with the various\nspecies of plants and animals out there – even though most of them don’t actually have\nfingers. Hi, I’m Kate and this is MinuteEarth. The kind of fingerprints I’m talking about\nstart not with fingers, but with light. When light hits, say, a pine tree, certain\nwavelengths of light reflect off the tree. Some of these reflected wavelengths are ones\nwe humans can see, but others are in the invisible part of the spectrum. If you could get a snapshot of all the light\n– both visible and invisible – that a pine tree reflects, you’d come up with this:\nwhat scientists call the species’ “spectral fingerprint.” Let’s compare that to the snapshot for a\ndifferent tree species nearby – say, a magnolia. At first glance, the spectral fingerprints\nof the two species look similar, just like the actual fingerprints of two people. But – like the tiny differences in those\nfingerprints’ swirls and whorls – there are tiny differences in how the two tree species\nreflect light, thanks to their slightly different chemical composition, crown and microscopic\nstructure, water content, and more. Since all tree species vary slightly in these\nkinds of characteristics, each species of tree has a distinctive spectral fingerprint. Which means it’s possible, based on a tree’s\nspectral fingerprint alone – to determine its species…and that has tree-mendous implications\nfor our planet. Tree-cologists can run fancy images from planes\nand satellites through computer programs trained on the spectral signatures of thousands of\ndifferent tree species, and the programs can identify the species that live there. The programs can even find trees that aren’t\ndoing well – and figure out the particular reason they aren’t doing well; like, an\noak tree is supposed to have a fingerprint like this. If it has a fingerprint like this, it’s\ndrier than it should be, suggesting drought. If it has a fingerprint like this, it’s\nhaving trouble photosynthesizing – it probably has a disease. You may have noticed that we’ve only been\ntalking trees so far. See, scientists have been working with trees’\nspectral fingerprints for a particularly long time, so they’ve been able to amass a big\nlibrary of different tree species’ fingerprints and start putting them to use. But as far as we know, every species – from\ncorals to fish to polar bears – reflects light in a slightly different way, and therefore\nhas a distinctive spectral fingerprint. So scientists are exploring other branches\nof the tree of life; they’re working to document the unique fingerprints of more and\nmore species, and figure out what we can accomplish with those fingerprints…. …things like finding polar bears on vast\nstretches of ice and assessing the health of huge underwater reefs. Which are, of course, tasks that are already\npossible without spectral fingerprints. But they generally require a lot of slow,\ndifficult, in-person research, often in places where it’s very hard to work. Spectral fingerprints are helping scientists\ncollect data about specific individuals and species more quickly and easily than ever\nbefore – as are other remote approaches like trail cams, GPS collars, environmental\nDNA, and acoustic monitoring. With these kinds of strategies, maybe we’ll\nbe able to save certain plants and animals before all we have left of them is their fingerprints. One group working hard to use spectral fingerprints\nto study and conserve biodiversity is the ASCEND project, a National Science Foundation-funded\nBiological Integration Institute led by Jeannine Cavender-Bares, Phil Townsend and Peter Reich. The ASCEND team is using spectroscopy in all\nsorts of ways, from finding and mapping sick trees to prevent the spread of disease, to\ntracking biodiversity over time to see if efforts and policies are making a difference. In addition to advancing knowledge, ASCEND\nis training the next generation of integrative biologists to understand how life’s variation\nis connected across scales and impacted by global change."

    "content": "Hi, this is David from MinuteEarth. In 1985, we \nfound out that the world as we knew it was ending:   the ozone layer - the natural atmospheric \nlayer that shields the Earth from the sun's   super-damaging UV rays - had - in certain spots \n- lost 40% of its thickness in the previous 10   years. If the trend continued, the shield would \nhave become so compromised that in a matter   of decades, UV rays would destroy the world’s \nfood supply and cause blindness and skin cancer   epidemics around the world. But here we are, \nfour decades later - we’ve got lots of problems,   but an ozone-instigated dystopia ain't \none. And that's because back in 1985,   we followed a surprisingly simple formula that \nhelped us stave off the impending ozo-pocalypse.  Step 1: Understand the problem. What was \ndestroying ozone - the gas that makes up   the ozone layer? Man-made molecules called \nCFCs, found in everything from hairsprays   to refrigerators, were a prime suspect. And \nscientists found that when those molecules   reach ice-cold stratospheric clouds and get \nhit by ultraviolet radiation from the Sun,   they release chlorine atoms that go on a \nturbo-charged ozone-destroying rampage,   where each chlorine atom can destroy \na hundred thousand ozone molecules.  Step 2: Science your way to a plan. It soon became \nobvious: the CFCs needed to go. Because hundreds   of industries relied heavily on CFC molecules as \npropellants and refrigerants, scientists worked   overtime to create replacement molecules that \ncould do the same things CFCs could do but without   accompanying ozone-destroying side effects.\nStep 3: Get the political powers that be to agree.   By 1987 - just two years after the ozone \nhole was discovered - many of the world’s   most powerful nations signed a treaty - the \nMontreal Protocol - to stop producing CFCs,   which cut off the supply of CFCs going \ninto products - and therefore into the air.  Step 4: Take advantage of a little luck. Lots of \ndifferent things had to break our way to get the   Montreal Protocol signed. For example, then-US \npresident Ronald Reagan - one of the biggest   potential roadblocks due to his anti-regulation \nstance - happened to be a skin cancer survivor,   and his surprisingly enthusiastic support \nwas key to getting the treaty ratified.   Since then, the concentration of CFCs in \nthe atmosphere has been reduced by 98%   and we're on track to have our ozone shield \nback to its thick former glory by 2075.  We've used the same four-step formula to \nsuccessfully tackle other global crises,   too - like in eradicating smallpox. First, \nunderstanding: virologists figured out   that - unlike diseases like the bubonic plague \nand yellow fever that incubated in other   animals - smallpox was a uniquely homo sapien \ndisease that relied exclusively on human-to-human   spread. Second, a plan: if we could completely \nstop the virus's spread in humans, we could   kill it off for good. So public health officials \ncreated a strategy to send elite teams of vaccine   specialists to inoculate people whenever and \nwherever the disease flared up. Third, political   agreement: the World Health Organization got all \ncountries on board in 1966 for the Intensified   Eradication Program to put the plan into action. \nFourth, we took advantage of a lucky break:   Smallpox survivors share distinct scars that \nare super recognizable, so it was easy to spot   disease flare ups and rapidly vaccinate everyone \nnearby. By 1979, there were zero people on earth   infected with smallpox - it was eradicated, which \nhas already saved an estimated 200 million lives.  But just because there is a basic \nformula for staving off global disaster,   doesn't mean that actually following it \nhas been easy. And our current and future   crises - from climate change and a pandemic to \nnuclear war and disloyal AI - are only going   to be harder to solve; despite the fact that \nwe have more advanced science on our side,   we also have more divisive politics that make \nglobal cooperation even more fraught. But we’ve   successfully saved ourselves from destructive \nmolecules and pathogens in the past - and if   we follow the formula, we should be able to \ndo it again. And again. And again. And again. This video was sponsored by the Future of Life \nInstitute to celebrate recipients of the Future   of Life Award. This award is given annually \nto individuals who have steered the course   of history away from disaster without having \nreceived much public recognition at the time.   The 2020 Award went to Viktor Zhdanov \nand Bill Foege for their contributions   to the eradication of smallpox, and \nthis year's award goes to Joe Farman,   Susan Solomon and Stephen Andersen for \ntheir roles in saving the ozone layer."

    "content": "Nuclear war would be catastrophic – but \nmaybe not just for the reasons you think.  Hi, I'm Cameron, and this is MinuteEarth.  Yes, it’s true that immediately following \nthe detonation of a nuclear weapon,   everything – and everyone – inside the blast zone \nis incinerated. And yes, over the following days,   weeks, and years, radiation poisoning causes death \nand debilitating disease in those just a little   farther afield. But that’s just the first domino \nof devastation: radioactive fallout, refugees,   looting, and large-scale damage to infrastructure \nwill all be bad, but the smoke is what has the   farthest-reaching – and deadliest – effects.\nWhen lots of smoke goes into the atmosphere at   one time, it absorbs sunlight, which means it \ncan affect the climate. After Mount Pinatubo   erupted in 1991, the resulting ash cloud \ntemporarily dropped global temperatures   by an average of a degree Celcius. Smoke from \nmega-wildfires can have similar local effects.  The smoke from a burning city is even \nmore of a problem, though. As cities,   with all of their buildings, plastics, asphalt, \netc – as all of this stuff burns... It creates   smoke with tons of free-floating groups of \ncarbon atoms known as “black carbon,” which   is the special sauce of our nuclear doom. \nThese dark particles soak up sunlight and   warm the surrounding air, making it buoyant \nand lofting the smoke into the stratosphere.  Smoke from wildfires and volcanoes also make \nit high in the air, but these sources don’t   produce much black carbon. As a result, their \nlighter-colored smoke doesn’t absorb as much   sunlight, and therefore won’t float very long. But \nsmoke made mostly of black carbon can stay aloft   for as long as a decade, riding air currents, \nand cooling the planet by absorbing the sun's   rays in the upper atmosphere so that they (and \ntheir heat) never make it to the surface below.  Scientists have recently calculated that just 15 \nnuclear bombs could create as much as five million   tons of black carbon – that’s enough to cool \nthe planet by an average of 2 degrees Celsius.  But wait a minute – we have detonated more than \n2,000 nuclear bombs – why haven’t we experienced   this cooling already? Well, the vast majority \nof nuclear detonations have happened either   high in the atmosphere, in remote places, or deep \nunderground. That’s all in order to minimize the   potential for damage – including the damage that \nwould be caused by megatons of black carbon soot.  Two nuclear bombs have been used to their \nfull – and devastating – potential. But,   somewhat frighteningly, those were small \nbombs compared to what we have now. Today,   not only are nuclear weapons way bigger, we \nalso have way more of them than we did then,   albeit not nearly as much as existed during the \nCold War. Still, a war between nuclear powerhouses   could create as much as 150 million tons of black \ncarbon, enough to drop global temperatures by an   average of 16 degrees. For reference, during the \nmost recent ice age – you know, when glaciers   covered half the earth – global temperatures \nwere just 7 degrees colder than they are now.  And if a nuclear-triggered mini ice age were to \noccur, it would freeze food production in most of   the world, many of those who manage to survive the \nbombs and radiation and freezing conditions would   suffer from inevitable global food shortages; as \nmany as 5 billion people worldwide might starve   in the first year – that’s nearly two-thirds of \nthe global population. At northern latitudes,   it gets even worse – up to 99% of \npeople there may starve to death.  A war that heats up to the point of going \nnuclear could leave everyone in the cold. This video was brought to you by the Future \nof Life Institute to celebrate recipients of   the Future of Life Award. This award is \ngiven annually to individuals who have   steered the course of history away from \ndisaster without having received much   public recognition at the time. The 2022 \nAward went to John Birks, Paul Crutzen,   Jeannie Peterson, Alan Robock, Carl Sagan, \nGeorgiy Stenchikov, Brian Toon and Richard   Turco for their roles in discovering and \npopularizing the science of nuclear winter."

    "content": "Hi, this is Kate from MinuteEarth. The fact that we humans - or any complex life\nforms - exist on our planet is kind of amazing. Somehow, the blob that debuted four billion\nyears ago found the resources it needed to survive and reproduce, and its offspring found\nthe resources they needed to survive and reproduce, and so on and so on. Those blobs evolved and diversified to occupy\npretty much every nook and cranny on Earth. But here’s evolution’s dirty secret: mostly,\nblobs - and species in general - go extinct. More than 99% of the species that ever evolved\non Earth have gone the way of the dodo… like, well, the dodo, the giant ground sloth\nand billions of other species. So what determines whether a species makes\nit or not? Well… [Jasper] Psst! Kate! Hey Kate! [Kate] Oh...hi Jasper...can this wait? I’m kind of in the middle of a video... [Jasper] I know - sorry to interrupt! But I built something that might help illustrate\nthis whole extinction thing; The MinuteLabs Evolution Simulator! It’s based off of the blob world built by\nour friend Justin of the Primer YouTube channel, and I’ve spent the last few months making\nit interactive. [Kate] So... [Jasper] … did I mention the viewers can\nsee it at www… [Kate] Jasper! Can you at least wait until the end of the\nvideo? [Jasper] Right! Sorry, I’m just excited. [Kate] Ok… so how does this help explain\nextinction? [Jasper] Well, we can use it to show different\nsituations that result in total blob-creature extinction! We start the simulation with blobs on the\nedge of the board and a certain amount of food pellets sprinkled around. The blobs all have particular traits that\ncan change with each new generation - like speed, size, and ability to detect food - and\nthey move around the board trying to find a pellet of food and get back to the edge\nbefore they run out of energy and... meet their maker. Any blob that finds two pellets before running\nout of energy will reproduce and create a new blob with traits that are slightly - and\nrandomly - different... it’s a simplified version of genetic mutation. I think it’s so cool to see how the traits\nof blobs change over time… and whether they make it at all. [Kate] Oh, ok, cool! So what have you found out about blob die-offs? [Jasper] Well, so what I found was that the\nmain cause of a population surviving or dying off was often a result of how quickly the\nenvironment changed. For example, if I decrease the amount of food\navailable by 80 pellets over ten generations, the traits of blobs across the population\ncan change fast enough to compensate for the lack of food. But if the change happens too quickly - like\nif I reduce the food available by 80 pellets in a single generation - the blob population\nwon’t have enough time to evolve and adapt, and they all just die off. [Kate] OK, interesting. The same thing happens in the real world...take,\nsay, ferrets, which can generally deal with fluctuations in their favorite foods, and\ntheir diets often change over time as their environment changes. But when a horde of Western settlers suddenly\nstarted obliterating the population of prairie dogs - the black footed ferret’s favorite-est\nfood - the ferrets couldn’t adjust to the sudden drop in their food supply, and they\nwent extinct in the wild. Of course, in nature there are usually a few\nspecies competing for the same food...any chance your blob world can handle more than\none species? [Jasper] Actually… I just added that feature! [Kate] And? [Jasper] Well let’s try it... here’s a\nsimulation with two blob species; the orange ones are faster, but the blue ones can see\nfarther. Hmm… As long as the amount of food remains the\nsame, they both can coexist for quite a long time. But… wait… let me try something… hey!\nif I suddenly reduce the food supply, all of a sudden the blue blobs start to take over\nand the orange ones die off. [Kate] That’s just like Tasmanian tigers\nand dingoes! [Jasper] Wait, what? [Kate] Well, those two carnivores used to\ncoexist without too much trouble, even though they ate more or less the same food, which\nwould ebb and flow over the years. But humans - once again! - pretty much decimated\nthe available prey. The dingos, which were stronger and hunted\ncooperatively, had an edge in finding scarce snacks, so they ended up surviving while the\nTasmanian tigers couldn’t get enough to eat, and went extinct on the Australian mainland. [Jasper] Oh that reminds me! Predation can also be a factor in blob-world\nextinction, like when a big predator blob is dropped onto a board filled with little\nblobs. Basically, any blob that is at least 20% bigger\nthan another blob can, well, eat it. If there’s no initial variation in size,\nblobs will slowly diversify into big blobs that quickly snag any food available to them\n- including their neighbours - and small blobs with lots of energy to spare that bop around\nlooking for leftovers. But look at this: if I start off with a world\nof small blobs, and I introduce even a single large blob into this world, it - and its progeny\n- will decimate all the small blobs in just a few generations. It seems that if the blue blobs had a chance\nto coevolve with the pink blob species, they might have time to adapt and avoid getting\neaten, but things happened so fast they didn’t stand a chance. [Kate] Exactly! Those poor little - delicious - blobs. This is what we see so often when invasive\nspecies dominate native ones. Take snakes and birds, which are species that\ncoexist all the time - assuming the birds evolved with the snakes and know to be wary\nof them. But when a single brown snake hitched a ride\ninto Guam, in just a few years she and her descendents killed off 12 native - and naive\n- bird species. [Jasper] Hmm… I’m starting to see a pattern… it seems\nlike all the extinction scenarios you’ve brought up happened because of us humans. [Kate] Yeah, I mean, we humans tend to change\nthings at a speed that evolution just can’t keep up with. As a result, species are going extinct at\nat least ten times the historical rate. But we aren’t the only bad guys - massive\nchange-y things like meteors and ice ages also seem to cause huge extinction events. [Jasper] But, at least for blobs, sometimes\nit seems like extinction can happen without any grandiose event at all… look at this:\nSometimes, when I run this simulation, these few blobs happily reproduce for hundreds of\ngenerations. But other times - when I keep the exact same\nparameters - they suddenly all die off in a few generations, with no interference at\nall! [Kate] That’s what’s so interesting about\nevolution! Sometimes, whether a species flourishes or\nfails can come down to luck. We know that, especially for certain kinds\nof animals - like those that naturally exist in low numbers and have big home ranges - small,\nrandom changes can kill off an entire species. I mean, the cave bear seemed to be doing fine\nfor tens of thousands of years with new humans around, but they suddenly went extinct because,\nwell, we dunno. [Jasper] Ugh, that’s a hard one to bear. I have one last thought that’s maybe a bit\nphilosophical… The simulator can run for a long time, and\nthe blob population can keep evolving for hundreds… or thousands of generations. But by the time the blobs are on their, I\ndunno, 600th generation, they are really different than when they started - like in this example,\nif we color the blobs a brighter shade of red the faster they are, you can see that\nthey become way faster and way bigger than they were at the start. So… are these blobs a new species? So...are these blobs a new species? And, if so, did the old species go extinct? [Kate] I mean, maybe? One of the really interesting things is that\nextinction isn’t necessarily about failure...Like, modern cows have changed so much since they\ndescended from a kind of wild ox - they’re way smaller, they have much bigger udders\n- so the two bovines are generally considered to be totally different species. And since there aren’t any more wild oxen,\nwe consider them to be extinct, while cows, obviously, are still milking life. But since they evolved directly from the wild\noxen, that extinction wasn’t really a dead end. In the same way, the very first blob species\nin the world likely went extinct not too long after it made its debut, but before it did,\na subgroup of the population evolved into a totally new species, which in turn evolved\ninto other species and so on, to form billions of species, 10 million of which are still\nalive and kicking...and flapping and crawling and...whatever this guy is doing - all thanks\nto a long-gone blob. [Jasper] … sooo… can i tell them where\nto find the app now? [Kate] Yeah, this is the ending screen, so...go\nfor it. [Jasper] Oh! Ok. So… you can find the Evolution Simulator\nusing the link I put in the video description or you can visit minutelabs.io and find a\nton of other fun labs to play around with too. I also made a video that goes into some of\nthe inner workings of the evolution simulator over on the MinuteLabs youtube channel…\nit’s right over here if you want to watch it. Anything else, Kate? [Kate] Yes! I want to thank The Great Courses Plus for\nsponsoring this video; we’re so excited to be able to let you all play around with\nthe simulator, and we couldn’t have done it without their financial support. As you all know by now, the Great Courses\nPlus is like Netflix for learning, with a library of more than 11,000 lectures. If you’re into evolution, I think you’ll\nlove the course called “Major Transitions In Evolution” which - over 24 30-minute\nepisodes - takes you on life’s journey from the first blob all the way through modern\nhumans.

    "content": "Hey, this is Kate from MinuteEarth. We recently reached 2 million subscribers,\nand as a way to say thanks for watching, we decided to make a video answering your most\ncommon questions. Here we go! Why do you make so many videos about poop? Well, some of our videos answer questions\nthat we on the MinuteEarth team actually have about the world, so I guess we have a lot\nof questions about poop. But also, everybody deals with excrement on\na daily – or hopefully almost daily – basis, but we don't usually stop and appreciate it,\nbecause it's just poop. And one of the things that makes science so\ncool is that it gives us a way to discover how even something as seemingly mundane as\na pile of crap is the result of complex, kind of beautiful processes, and there are whole\nworlds in there when we stop to look. Who’s behind MinuteEarth, and where are\nyou from? That’s a great question! We are a remote,\ninternet based team of people and we’ve got Henry Reich, David Goldenberg, Peter Reich,\nEmily Elert, Kate Yoshida, Alex Reich, Ever Salazar, and me, Melissa Hayes, along with\nNathaniel Schroeder, Qingyang Chen, Jesse Agar and Arcadi Garcia. Can you explain your stick figure backstory? Well, Kate lived among hyenas, David studied\nmonkeys, Alex likes fishing, and Henry made a video about what to do when it’s cold\noutside. Emily likes geology, I am an illustrator and\nlove math, Peter is into plants, Melissa raises bees, and Nathaniel plays our music. Qingyang loves Waffles, Jesse always wears\na wool hat in winter and Arcadi is the master of the Wingardium Huevosa spell. Plus we have made stick figures for a ton\nof our friends and other people. Do you have other jobs, hobbies, or projects? I help make Hot Mess and cross-country ski I make MinutePhysics and play in a bluegrass\nband I’m a scientist studying climate change\nand forests I have a long-dormant channel, that someday,\nwill rise from the ashes I work for a conservation organization that\nprotects wild lions And we’re working on a bunch of other projects,\nlike Paradigms and MinuteLabs and Bodypedia on Japan’s NHK! Going forward, I’m actually only going to\nbe working on those projects, rather than on normal MinuteEarth videos, so if you don’t\nhear my voice on the channel much anymore, that’s why. Who comes up with your puns, and is it hard? We all work together. Sometimes the magic hap-puns and other times\nit’s pun-ishing work. Why are your videos longer than a minute? Because... we’re... bad at editing?. How long does it take to make a video? Some of them come together really quickly\nand go from an idea to a video in a few weeks, but others take months or years. You can check out this video to learn more\nabout our production process. Is MinuteEarth an ASAPScience knockoff? No, in fact ASAPScience was actually kind of a MinutePhysics knockoff. MinuteEarth was a MinutePhysics spinoff. Why are lions the only cats with manes? Lions’ manes signal strength to rivals and\nworthiness to potential mates. For other felines, manes might be a liability,\nor those species just might not need such big, braggy signals...but for more on that,\nyou’ll have to watch our monogamy video! How did we eradicate Cholera? Uhhh… we didn’t? We did eradicate smallpox though! Mostly through vaccines. They really work! Is MinuteEarth available in other languages? Yes, in Spanish (also known as Castillian),\nin French, in Italian, and in Portuguese (Brazilian). Why can’t two people have the same fingerprints? Well, actually, stay tuned! We're making a video about that right now! Mountain or Beach? Beach! Mountain! Beech! Can you answer this question? Hmmmm… Which countries watch MinuteEarth the most? The most viewers come from these five countries\n. But per capita, these are the top five If you could bring an extinct creature back\nfrom extinction, which would you choose and why? Nope...just nope. Haven't you seen Jurassic Park? What’s your favorite MinuteEarth video? My favorite is “Ambergris: Why Perfume Makers\nLove Constipated Whales”, because it’s basically a big poop video. If I had to pick right now, I’d choose \"Are\nany Animals Truly Monogamous?\" because it’s weird and surprising and has my favorite ending\npun. My favorite video is “This Is Not a Bee”\nbeecause it covers a few of my favorite topics: mimicry and bees. My favorite is “Climate Change: The View\nFrom MinuteEarth” because it’s personal and about fixing climate change. My favorite one is “Why Do We Eat Spoiled\nFood?” because I really like cheese. And chocolate. And kimchi. I am incapable of choosing, so I made a list\nof my favorites. How can we support MinuteEarth? What a great question! Thanks for asking! First, you can support us by continuing to\nwatch MinuteEarth and sharing it with your friends and family. You can support us financially by becoming\na Patreon patron or, if you run a company or a foundation you can actually sponsor videos\ndirectly. We appreciate you count MinuteEarth among\nthe things worth spending your time on and we hope you’ll consider adding it to the\nthings worth spending your money on, too. After all, bad puns aren’t going to write\nthemselves. Unless we find a self punning pen. So, the question is: who is this?... Who is this? Can Ever figure it out? Yeah… mystery voice… Well, I’m sure… hmm… yeah, anyway. Is it going? Yeah it’s going Oh, hahahaha, ok… alright… ok… that\nmight sound dumb though. That sounds great! I mean, Ever can decide. Ok. He’s the dictator on this."

    "content": "Hi! I'm Emily from MinuteEarth. Or, as I've\nsometimes heard it pronounced, \"my-nute Earth.\" Coming up, we've got four short stories about the science of size, why big things are big, small things are small, and as far as Mother Nature is concerned, size really does matter. First up, a quest for the biggest organism on the planet. Blue whales are the biggest animals ever to exist on Earth. They can weigh upwards of 150 tons, which is more than the largest dinosaurs. But the blue whale is not the biggest living thing. That title goes to... well, it depends on what you mean by \"biggest.\" The tallest may be a California redwood nicknamed \"Hyperion.\" At a towering 115 meters, this giant is taller than the Statue of Liberty. The most extensive organism is a very old humongous fungus that covers a whopping 2385 acres in a national forest in Oregon. At the base of trees, bunches of honey mushrooms appear. They are the fruiting bodies produced by the fungus, which otherwise lives out of sight. Imagine if apple trees grew underground and only the apples apples were visible to us. That's basically what the fungus does, except that it spreads its mycelia not just through the soil, but also through the roots and bark of trees in the forest, attacking them and stealing their nutrients, so it can continue spreading outwards. However, if we're talking about the good old heaviest organism ever found, that prize goes to a giant panda living high on a Utah plateau. Just kidding. It goes to a single quaking aspen named \"Pando\" that weighs over 6000 tonnes, as much as 40 blue whales. If you go to the Fish Lake National Forest, though, you won't see a giant tree trunk. You'll just see a forest of regular sized trees. But thanks to genetic testing, we've  learned that this stand of aspen\ncovering 106 acres of land is actually a single clonal organism that grew from a\nlone seed long ago. That single tree was able to spread so much because its roots\nsend up shoots that grow into what look like individual trees. Since all 47,000\ntrees are part of the same organism, the forest behaves somewhat unusually. For\nexample, the entire forest transitions simultaneously from winter to spring and\nuses its vast network of roots to distribute water and\nnutrients from trees with plenty to trees in need. Speaking of water, if you\ninclude water when weighing these giant organisms, then the humongous fungus\nmight actually way more than Pando but foresters at least care only about the\nmass actually produced during growth, the dry mass. And since fungi are mostly\nwater, Pando wins. Either way it's likely that\nsome of the below ground connections whether roots or mycelia, have become\nsevered over time, meaning these giants are probably comprised of smaller but\nstill ginormous and genetically identical patches. And finally, because of\nthe extensive testing required to confirm \"biggest anything\" claims, the\nfungus and Aspen can only profess to be the largest living organisms ever found. There may be even bigger monsters lurking right under our feet just\nwaiting to be discovered. So, it's possible that the biggest\norganism hasn't been discovered yet, even if it isn't possible that that organism is an underground panda. The thing is, though, animals don't just\nwake up one day gigantic. Something weird has to happen to make them that way. Animals come in all different sizes but usually over evolutionary time each type of animal stays roughly the same size. Every once in a while though, something\ncrazy happens that allows an animal to get truly gigantic. Take insects and\nother arthropods, which have tiny bodies, in part because they breathe by sponging up air through their exoskeletons, and the available oxygen can only diffuse so far before getting used up. If they had bigger bodies oxygen wouldn't reach far\nenough inside. But about 300 million years ago, Earth's atmospheric oxygen\nlevels spiked. With more oxygen in the air, arthropods' bodies could grow way bigger, leading to mega-bugs like a dragonfly\nthe size of an eagle, and a millipede the size of a two-person kayak. Dinosaurs on\nthe other hand got pretty darn big without any outside help, but at some\npoint they hit a limit due to the so-called \"square-cube law\": body strength is based on a cross sectional area of bones and muscles, but weight is based on\nvolume, and just like doubling the height of a cube causes its cross-sectional area to get four times larger but its volume to\nget eight times larger, when an animal gets bigger, it does get stronger, but it\ngets WAY heavier. Fossil evidence suggests that dinos were nearing the\nsize of which they could no longer lug around their own bodies, when they\nstumbled upon an evolutionary breakthrough: a system of air pockets and air sacs throughout their skeletons that allow them to get bigger without getting\nheavier, and have incredibly long but light necks, which granted them access to a\nhuge bounty of leaves. Eventually though, a group of land animals got around the\nsquare-cube problem altogether by climbing back into the water, which\nbuoyed their weight. And since they took their lungs with them into the water,\nthey could breathe oxygen-rich air, rather than being stuck with oxygen-poor\nwater, allowing these mammals to grow almost twice as big as the biggest fish.\nBut these giant creatures just didn't have enough food to get any gianter than\nthat. Then, a few million years ago, changing ocean currents brought tons of\nnutrients up from the depths, which fuel huge localized phytoplankton blooms,\nwhich in turn attracted enormous concentrations of scrumptious zooplankton. With this new \"krillion\"-calorie diet together with their air-breathing lungs\nand water-supported bodies, blue whales quickly tripled in size\nto become not just gigantic, but truly the largest animals to have ever lived.\nAnd that is certainly something to spout about. In the ocean life comes in all sizes. It turns out that we humans need to be\neating more of the small stuff. Anyone who goes fishing probably has a story about the one that got away. \"It was this big, don't cha know!\" Yeah, that was a bummer, but it's actually quite important that big fish get away, both for fish and\nfishermen. For most of the species that we fish, commercial and recreational\nfishermen are only allowed to keep individuals above a minimum legal size. The idea behind these laws is to protect juveniles so they can grow big enough to\nreproduce at least once before becoming our dinner. In theory, that means there\nwill always be enough fish for dinner tomorrow, and ensuring dinner for\ntomorrow is important enough that the English Parliament discussed protecting\nyoung―that is, small―fish as early as 1376, and today it's a common regulation for fisheries worldwide, except it doesn't really work. \nFirst, large individuals have the greatest number of successful offspring,\nboth because bigger fish produce more eggs and because the eggs they produce\nalso contain a more generous food supply for the baby fishies. So by removing the\nlargest individuals of a given species, we severely decrease the population's\nability to replenish itself. Second, if we only remove the largest fish, that means\nfish that are small for their age and thus smaller when they first reproduce, \nare more likely to live long enough to make babies, so individuals with small\nfish genes tend to stay in the water, reproduce and pass on their genes to new\ngenerations, while big fish and big fish genes become rarer and rarer. We're\nbasically breeding smaller fish, unintentionally, and it's not a small\nchange. Size-selective fishing has caused the body mass of large commercial fish\nto be cut in half over the last 40 years. Let me say that again. Heavily-fished\nfish are now half the weight they used to be. Six-year-old haddock, for example,\nweigh 40% of what they did in 1970 Imagine if full-grown men weighed 65\npounds! Clearly, size-selective fishing means fewer and smaller fish in the\nwater, which suggests it's not the best way to keep our fish supply stocked for\nfuture human generations. And in fact, there's a new idea called\n\"balanced harvesting\" ready to save the day. Instead of reeling in all the\nlargest individuals, fishermen would catch a smaller number of fish across a\nwider range of sizes, keeping the numbers and sizes of fish... well, balanced. However, old habits die hard, and the use of size limits is deeply ingrained in our\ncollective fisheries management DNA, but sooner rather than later, we'll have to accept that it's good to let some of the big ones get away, for\nonly they can change the course of fish-tory. Fish-tory! We can't be proud of all of\nour puns, but while we're talking tiny and water, let's talk about tiny water. How\nmany water molecules does it take to make a drop? Somewhere inside of every\nraindrop is a tiny impurity―a touch of salt, a speck of soot, a grain of clay―that's absolutely crucial to the raindrop's existence. In fact, without\nthese microscopic pieces of dirt there would be no rain because water vapor\ncan't condense into droplets on its own, which is kind of weird because water\nmolecules like each other. If they didn't, they wouldn't cling to each other like\nthis, and in the air vaporized water molecules collide and stick together all\nthe time, but they also break apart all the time, thanks to bond-breaking heat energy. Only when the air cools down past a certain point called the \"dew point\" does this breaking apart slow down enough for\nlittle clusters of water molecules to grow into droplets. But actually, that's\nonly true if the cluster is big to start with. If it's too small its surface is so\ncurved that the molecules on the outside have few neighbors to bond to which\nmakes them easy to break off so the cluster as a whole has higher chances of\nlosing molecules than gaining them, even below dew point, which means that up\nuntil a certain critical size, a cluster's chances of shrinking are better than its\nodds of growing. Unfortunately, that critical size is 150 million molecules,\nand while there are millions of 5-molecule clusters in a golf ball-sized volume of air at dew point, odds are that only one of those clusters will grow to\na size of 10, and you'd need a golf ball of air 10 million miles across to find a\nsingle 50 molecule cluster, which basically means that clusters of water\nmolecules never get to that 150 million mark on\ntheir own. Fortunately, they don't have to! They can start off at that critical size\nby condensing onto one of the gajillions of little pieces of dirt floating in our\natmosphere and then grow and grow until they're a droplet in a rain cloud and\nultimately it's these little pieces of dirt surrounded by water that make life\npossible on our big piece of dirt surrounded by water. And, from my spot on\nthis big piece of dirt, thanks for watching!"

    "content": "Recently, we got a phone call from some bird\nscientists up in rural Alaska. They had started working with students from\nthe local village school to learn from each other about the area and its amazing birds. The students had a big idea: they wanted to\nmake a series of videos so they could share this knowledge with other village schools\nin Alaska. And then they had an even bigger idea – what\nif they could share what they had learned about birds and migration with, well, everyone? That’s when we were called in. So we got on a big plane and then on a way\nsmaller plane. And then after that, we got in a car. And when the car got stuck in the snow, we\ngot in an ATV. And finally, we reached the village and the\nschool. That's when we got to meet the coolest, most\ninspiring group of students that we have ever had the privilege of working with. And after a lot of time spent talking and\nresearching and drawing, we came up with the videos you’re about to watch. Enjoy! This bird has a superpower most animals don’t\nhave: it can fly. And the reason birds can fly is because every\npart of their body is optimized for an airborne life. Birds would never get off the ground without\ntheir wings. Bird wings are basically modified arms geared\ntoward flying. This is what a bird wing looks like from the\nside – see how it is curved? When this shape moves through air, that curve\ncatches air and redirects it downward, creating a force called lift. To keep the wing moving through the air, the\nbird has to flap it, generating a force called thrust. And as long as enough air is moving across\nthe bird’s wing, that wing will soar. But flap as much as they like, birds would\nnot get very far without feathers. Each feather has a central vein with little\nhair-like barbs to either side that interlock like little zippers, which make the feather\nact like a little kite. Feathers are made of keratin, which is the\nsame stuff your fingernails are made of. Keratin is great for feather-making, because\nit is both strong and light. All of the feathers of a wing work together\nto give the wing as much surface area as possible in order to catch the most air. In order to keep air flowing across those\nfeathered wings, birds need really strong muscles, and even those muscles still need\na little help. That’s why a bird’s wing-flapping muscles\nare anchored to a strong bone called the keel bone, which makes it easier for those muscles\nto keep flapping the wings. Because flying takes more energy than running,\nbirds have to take in a lot of oxygen to keep from getting out of breath. This means that birds have really efficient\n– and kinda weird – respiratory systems. They don’t just have two lungs like we do\n– they also have air sacs tucked away in their bodies to hold extra air. Birds also have a one-way respiratory system\n– the air takes a linear path from the air sacs to the lungs and back out. In this way, air travels through a bird’s\nbody the way blood travels through your arteries. Speaking of arteries, birds also have really\nbig hearts to pump blood to their energy-hungry muscles, and they have big brains because\nflying requires smarts – I mean, they have to be quick thinkers to avoid flying into\ntrees. But there is a tradeoff – for some parts\nto become heavier, others had to become lighter. For example, birds lost many unneeded bones,\nlike fingers, and even gave up their teeth and jaws, opting instead for lighter beaks. Birds don’t even bother with a bladder – in\nother words, birds can’t even hold their pee because it might weigh them down too much. This seems like a lot of trouble to go to\njust to be able to fly. But flying lets birds forage for food in ways\nthat other animals can’t and it allows them to build their homes in places that hungry\npredators have a hard time getting to. Not to mention birds can travel all over the\nworld – not even oceans get in their way. Flying requires lots of adaptations, and lots\nof sacrifices – but if you ask a bird, the best way to get around is to get off the ground. Being able to fly means that birds can move\naround from place to place pretty easily. Almost half of bird species use their wings\nto migrate – which means that they travel to a different place when the seasons change. Some of them, like the waxwing, only migrate\na few hundred miles, while the Arctic Tern has the longest migration in the world, flying\nfrom the farthest reaches of the north to the farthest reaches of the south and back\nevery single year. A bar-tailed godwit spends its summers in\nAlaska, where it happily probes for berries, beetles, and worms with its narrow beak. But when summer’s bounty ends, most of that\nfood goes away, and the godwits fly to warmer climates where food is more abundant. But they can’t stay there forever, either. Many of these southern spots are crowded with\nbirds – migrants and residents alike. So the godwits take to the wing again, flying\nback north in the spring to breed and take advantage of all the food spring brings up\nnorth. Migrations, especially long ones, can be exhausting\njourneys; flying across land – or the open ocean – is risky. Many times, there isn’t much for migrants\nto eat along the way, so they take care to pack for their journeys. And by pack, I mean, pack on the fat. When the bar-tailed Godwit leaves Alaska for\nNew Zealand, nearly 50% of its mass is body fat to fuel the journey. Many birds also migrate at night – when\nmost would-be predators are sleeping. Some that fly during the day avoid predators\nby flying in huge flocks so more eyes can scan the horizon for threats. Flying in flocks can have an added bonus:\ncertain formations can reduce wind resistance, which means that each individual bird can\nspend less energy on the wing. Birds are incredible navigators that can travel\nhalf the world to find the same patch of forest or ponds every single year. Many birds learn their migration routes from\nolder, more experienced birds while others make their migrations alone following maps\nencoded in their genes. They track their positions using the sun,\nstars, and even landmarks like rivers. But when all of these things fail, some birds\ncan navigate by sensing the Earth’s magnetic field, although scientists aren’t completely\nsure how they manage to do it. But birds can’t control everything. Hurricanes and other storms make flying over\nthe ocean perilous, while wildfires and floods can destroy stopover habitat. Humans pose a risk to migrants, too. Light pollution, tall buildings, and even\nfishing nets are all dangers that birds face on their journeys. And as the climate continues to change and\nlandscapes continue to shift, birds have had to change their migration strategies in response. Some are starting their migrations earlier,\nwhile others are shrinking their bodies and lengthening their wings to deal with leaner,\nmore stressful flights. Thanks to skills they’ve honed over the\nmillennia, migrating birds are adjusting to the new world. They might be flying into the unknown, but\nthey aren’t totally winging it. Humans have long noticed that birds have a\ntendency to disappear – at least for part of the year. At first, they had no idea where the birds\nwent off to, but that didn’t stop them from making some pretty creative guesses. The Greek philosopher Aristotle suggested\nthat Redstarts - which spend Summers in Greece, annually morphed into Robins, which only spend\nwinters in Greece. While later, a predominant theory held that\nsome birds hibernate on the bottoms of lakes. And people as far back as the roman empire\nassumed the masses of geese that arrived every year were hatching out of… barnacles?!. We now know that they were all wrong – these\nideas persisted because, for most people, the idea that some birds spend half the year\nhalfway around the world would have sounded even more absurd. One of the first hints that birds spend time\nabroad came in the form of an accidental message from an African hunter in 1822, when a stork\narrived – alive – in Europe with that hunter’s spear sticking through its neck. Fast-forward eighty years, to around 1900,\nwhen people began purposefully sending birds away with their own messages, thanks to a\nDanish teacher’s technique of attaching marked aluminum rings to birds’ legs and\nthen re-releasing them. Each recapture or sighting of a banded bird\nput a dot on the map, and soon, long-distance migrations were confirmed when a white stork\nthat had been banded in Hungary was found dead in South Africa. But banding can only tell researchers about\nsingle points along a bird’s migratory path – not what happens BETWEEN those points. We didn’t get our first glimpse of the routes\nbirds took until the 1940s, when it turned out that radar, which had been developed to\ntrack both airplanes and rain, was also great for tracking masses of birds. Radar allowed us to see the size of migratory\nflocks moving en masse under the cover of night for the first time, but we weren't able\nto get individual data until 1984 when a bald eagle in Maryland was captured and fitted\nwith a transmitter powerful enough to send signals to a pair of orbiting satellites. Satellite tracking revealed details of some\nremarkable migrations, like the bar-tailed godwit's annual flight from Alaska to New\nZealand, during which the bird covers 11,000 km in about eight days without a single stop. But there’s a serious limitation to satellite\ntracking devices: even with modern technology, transmitters with enough oomph to send signals\nto satellites are still far too heavy for small songbirds. A slight improvement is to use GPS recorders,\nwhich can be smaller because they receive rather than send signals to satellites – but\nthey’re still too heavy for the smallest songbirds. Luckily, scientists have been clever enough\nto realize they don’t need satellite tracking at all! Instead, we can fit birds with a tiny device\nthat includes a sunlight detector, electronic clock, and memory chip, which together weigh\nas little as a raisin. Lightweight light-recorders don’t broadcast\nso we need to recapture the birds to get the data, but we can then use ancient navigation\nmethods to reconstruct the bird’s daily location over the course of its journey: the\nlength of each day is an indicator of latitude, and the time halfway between sunrise and sunset\n(that is, noon) is an indicator of longitude. These clever geolocators have shed light on\nthe world’s speediest migration: the great snipe, which weighs about 170 grams, high-tails\nit from Sweden to Central Africa in just three days, averaging 95 km/h. Another marathon migrator, the Arctic tern,\nhas long been credited with the longest migration for its annual round-trip flight between the\nArctic and Antarctic – an estimated 40,000 km. But recent data from light-level geolocators\nshow that terns actually travel more than twice as far each year, possibly to take advantage\nof prevailing winds. While scientists have learned a lot about\nthe specifics of bird migration, they are not the only ones contributing to migratory\nbird science. Regular folks like you and me are also helping\nscientists learn about bird migration. By pooling the observations of thousands of\neager birdwatchers who contribute data to online databases, scientists can learn about\nhow migration timings, migratory stopover locations, and breeding ranges are changing\nover time, which would be tough to study with GPS locators alone. So an investigation into migration that began\nwith inquisitive regular folks watching birds is now back to, well, inquisitive regular\nfolks watching birds. You might even say we've migrated full circle. We had so much fun working with the students\nof Tebughna school. and we are thrilled that we had the opportunity\nto share their work with you. Remember those bird researchers we mentioned\nat the start? They’re all part of Nate Senner’s research\nlab at the Department of Environmental Conservation at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Thanks to funding from the National Science\nFoundation, they’re not only able to spend time working with the local community, they're\nalso helping to crack the secrets of long distance migration. Every spring, Nate and his fellow researchers\nmigrate up to Alaska to slog through muddy bogs in order to study Hudsonian Godwits,\nwhich take a marathon trip up from Chile every year. The scientists search for their godwit nests,\ncount eggs and babies, and identify birds that they banded in previous years, they monitor\nthe food godwits eat, and the predators that eat godwits as they try to learn more about\nthe one of the world’s most impressive migrators and understand how it’s navigating challenges\nlike climate change and habitat loss in an ever-changing world.

    "content": "Watson, what are you doing? Air conditioners are a modern wonder. They've saved countless lives during heat waves, cooled giant servers to essentially make the internet possible, and in general, made life in warm places more comfortable. But keeping our indoor climate cool has ironically made the outdoor climate much warmer, and fixing the planet-warming effect of air conditioners is going to be one of the major challenges of the 21st century. For now, heating buildings is still a larger overall contributor to climate change than air conditioners, because more people use heat for more hours. But air conditioning heats the planet in nefarious and subtle ways that are going to be harder to address. For example, to heat our buildings we burn fossil fuels, which releases heat and heat-trapping CO2. But air conditioning also burns fossil fuels, just out of sight. And that's not their only problem. The way that air conditioners cool buildings is by moving heat from inside to outside. They can pump out enough heat to warm an entire city by a few degrees. And on top of that, when we get rid of our old air conditioners, most of their chemical refrigerants leak out and evaporate. And while only a small overall amount leak out, it just so happens that the refrigerants we use are thousands of times more powerful than CO2 at trapping the Earth's heat. So they warm the earth nearly 60% extra on top of the warming from the CO2 released to run the air conditioners. Then as the earth gets warmer, we use more air conditioning, which warms the earth even more in a vicious feedback cycle that's only going to get worse over time and as developing countries get richer and more people have access to air conditioners. Compared to today, we're going to be using four times as many air conditioners in 2050. And at some point we're going to be using more energy for air conditioning than for heating. To avoid the immense global impact this will have, we'll need to use the most efficient air conditioners and generate electricity in a way that doesn't release heat or CO2. When we get rid of our old air conditioners, we'll need to recycle or destroy their refrigerants rather than, you know, letting them leak out everywhere. And we'll have to switch over to refrigerants that, even if they do leak, won't trap heat. We'll also have to figure out how to use less air conditioning, some of which we can do by using fans until it gets too hot, and some of which we'll have to do by building buildings that are naturally cooler: buildings with shiny white roofs that reflect heat or green roofs that reflect, insulate, and evaporate; buildings with rooms that have windows on opposite sides so air can easily flow through, creating a natural breeze; and buildings whose walls are made of materials that can absorb lots of heat, without letting it inside, to keep people cool in the day and then release it overnight. And we'll need to go even further by redesigning our entire cities to include more green spaces with trees that can provide shade, encourage hot air to mix with cool air, and cool the air themselves through evaporation. Or we could do nothing, but that definitely wouldn't be. Sorry, that first intro was a little rough and unexpected, just like we humans never expected that cooling ourselves off would actually heat ourselves up in the long run. And that's kind of a pattern for us. We are masters of unintended consequences. It seems like for every action we take, no matter how well-intentioned it is, there's a bigger and unanticipated reaction. Like fighting forest fires---that can't be a bad thing, right? Well... Survivors of the 1871 fire in Peshtigo, Wisconsin, which vaporized 1.5 million acres of forest and killed 1500 people, reported a wall of flame five miles wide that traveled at 90 miles per hour and tossed trains into the air. Four decades later, an even larger inferno roared through the Rocky Mountains, scorching an area the size of Connecticut. These epic wildfires, and similar ones in between, helped spawn the US Forest Service and forged its aggressive policy to not only prevent wildfires, but to smother any that did start by no later than 10:00 a.m. the next day. And for a time, this policy seemed to work. The annual number of fires and area burned plummeted between 1920 and 1970, but fewer fires led to denser, more flammable forests packed with the combustible needles of young conifers and the tinder-dry branches of dead or dying trees. So despite a continuing decline in the number of wildfires since 1970, the average blaze today burns hotter, faster, and bigger than it used to. And the total area burned per year in the US has more than doubled. Costs have flared too. The Forest Service now spends 52% of its annual budget on fire prevention and suppression, up from 16% just 20 years ago. What's more, wildfires will keep getting harder to tame as climate change turns forests hotter and drier and homes edge further into fire-prone regions. The good news is that we can prevent future wildfires from getting so wild by taming forests' fuel supply now. Essentially, this means letting some fires burn or even starting them ourselves when conditions aren't too dry or windy---or selectively logging to thin out dangerously crowded growth. When and where we've used it, this strategy has made fires cooler, slower, and less destructive. For instance, when a blaze ripped through Okanogan County in Washington State in 2006, untamed swaths of forests lost 92% of their trees, while just 49% perished in areas recently thinned by cutting and controlled burns. And in 2002, parcels of recently burned land put the brakes on wildfires racing across Arizona's pine forests. These and other successes have led forest managers to prescribe controlled burning for much of the fire-prone western US, but few forests actually receive their recommended dosage. That's largely because, while the US Forest Service can, in theory, write prescriptions for every tract of land it manages, it relies on Congress for the money to fill them, and so far Congress allocates the vast majority of fire management funds to emergency measures rather than preventive ones. Plus, while emergency costs continue to surge, the Forest Service's budget doesn't. So fire managers are often forced to steal money from already meager fuel reduction programs to fight this year's blazes, thus fueling the risk that next year's fires will be costlier, deadlier, and more disastrous. So as counterintuitive as controlled burns may seem, it's time for Congress to understand that by not playing with fire, they are playing with fire. And wildfires aren't the only thing we've managed to make worse. Humans have inadvertently unleashed all sorts of plagues on our planet. While newer health threats grab most of the headlines, malaria (the mosquito-borne, cell-rupturing blood parasite) remains among the world's deadliest infectious diseases. But before we go blaming that on malaria, it's worth noting that we humans made this parasite the killer it is today. That's not to say we somehow invented malaria. It evolved way before we did, in Sub-Saharan Africa, likely from an aquatic algae that somehow began hitching mosquito rides into lots of animals and feasting on their liver and blood cells. Eventually, about half a million years ago, it landed in humans. But the earliest forms of human malaria weren't actually that deadly. In fact, because human populations were so scattered and small, any mega deadly varieties of malaria would have quickly stranded themselves and fizzled out. Instead, the earliest malaria parasites wreaked slow havoc on their hunter-gatherer hosts, allowing themselves years to hitchhike from group to group. But then humans invented agriculture, which turned out to be a real game changer for malaria for two reasons: First, clearing forests for cropland increased the number of puddles, or as we might as well call them: mosquito sex dens. Second, our new stable food source led to bigger denser human populations. Enter Plasmodium falciparum, a new, nasty strain of malaria that had recently hopped over from gorillas to humans and just so happened to travel extremely well inside the very types of mosquitoes we were accidentally breeding. And despite being far deadlier than its predecessors, falciparum never fizzled out because ever-growing human settlements ensured that it never ran out of victims. Eventually, it spread through dense human populations around the world. And today, falciparum still kills nearly half a million people each year. Thanks, agriculture. Agriculture: bringing you better food, bloodthirstier mosquitoes, and deadlier malaria since 3000 BCE! (rapidly) Exact date uncertain. Arrived in Africa between 8,000 and 2000 BCE. See paleontology for details. Ugh, talk about a buzzkill. Someone once called MinuteEarth an \"adorable preview for the end of the world.\" And it can feel like that sometimes, especially when we're talking about all the ways that we humans have messed up our planet, intentionally or not. But it isn't all bad news. Sometimes the unanticipated results of our actions can actually be the bomb! Or not-the-bomb? Well, you'll see. Nuclear apocalypse would be pretty bad. So in the 1990s, most of the world's governments formally agreed to a deal to outlaw tests of nuclear weapons. To hold each other accountable, they set up a global network of sensors that pick up the low-frequency waves that nuclear explosions send over long distances. With a few notable exceptions, most countries adhere to the rules. So nuclear tests are pretty rare, and the network mostly picks up signals from other sources like volcanoes, rocket explosions, ship engines, and even the vibrations of icebergs. This background noise is a headache for the people listening for nuclear explosions, but it's a boon for lots of other listeners who can also access the data with permission. For instance, instead of chasing down whales and attaching tracking devices to them, scientists can use their songs to estimate their locations. By listening to all the meteoroids that travel through Earth's atmosphere, we've learned that there are way more out there than what we can see, suggesting that the risk of a city-destroying meteorite is as much as 10 times higher than we earlier believed. By monitoring active volcanoes or even setting off controlled explosions and measuring how little of the energy boomerangs back to the sensors, scientists have found that the winds way above Earth's surface are faster and more variable than we thought, which is part of the reason our current weather forecasts aren't that great. And speaking of forecasts, data from the network sensors also help us locate earthquake epicenters to provide better warnings about potential tsunamis. The system may have been built to detect nuclear tests, but it's led to an explosion of knowledge about our planet and to a lot more questions. Like what is responsible for all of the sound waves that we haven't identified yet? Watson! Again? Okay. Brilliant does not sell human brains for dogs. Sorry, Watson.

    "content": "In addition to being stinky and gross, human poop \ncontains dangerous microbes that kill hundreds of   thousands of people each year. So it's no wonder \nthat we generally try to get rid of our poops as   fast as possible. But those dangerous microbes \nare just a tiny part of our poops; our collective   sewage also contains lots of resources that – at \nleast for now – we’re mostly just flushing away.   So let’s take a moment to really appreciate all of \nthe parts of our poops – not just the bad stuff.   In fact, let’s make a fecal pie chart.\nHi, I’m David and this is MinuteEarth.  Here’s our pie chart of everything that’s \nin poop. Let’s start with that bad stuff,   which can include everything from certain strains \nof E.coli to salmonella to rotaviruses to giardia.   These pathogens, though, are generally only \npresent in the poop of people with GI problems;   in healthy people’s poop, they’re basically \nnon-existent. So when we combine lots of   people’s poops together in our sewage systems, \nthey make up a tiny tiny slice of the pie.  On the other hand, the “good” microbe slice of the \npoop pie is freakin’ huge. Literally half of your   poop consists of actual bacteria. These bacteria \nlive in your colon and break down food components   like fiber, complex carbohydrates, and protein. \nEach time you poop, about a third of all of your   colon bacteria get expelled. No worries though \n– the rest of the remaining microbes reproduce   quickly, so they can get back to making more poop.\nThe next slice of the poop pie is undigested plant   matter. Mammals that regularly eat materials like \ncellulose and other vegetable fibers often have   extra long digestive tracts with specialized \nplant-digesting enzymes and bacteria. Or,   alternatively, they eat their poop to give \ntheir guts another go at digestion. Humans   don’t do either of those things, which means \nthat we often poop out a good portion of the   plant matter we eat, including fiber and \ncellulose. The next poop slice is mostly   protein that comes from things like undigested \nmeat, mucus and shed intestinal cells. Next up   are fats – either extra fat straight from the food \nyou eat that your body doesn’t need or the fatty   acids that get formed when your colon bacteria \ndigest things like carbohydrates. And finally,   there’s everything else, like extra phosphates \nfrom foods like milk and eggs, along with other   indigestible things like heavy metals and plastics \nthat we didn’t necessarily eat on purpose.  Right now, our relationship with sewage – you \nknow, where we try to get rid of it as fast as   possible – is driven by that tiny, dangerous slice \nof the pie. And yeah, also the fact that poop is   gross, but that’s likely a totally appropriate \npsychological response to that danger. If we   can somehow get past that part – like, if we can \nreliably kill off the bad microbes in our sewage   and get over the gross-out factor – then we can \nstart to think more about all the other slices,   and what we can do with them. Many sewage \ntreatment plants are already harnessing the   good bacteria’s gas-making power as a new energy \nsource. And a few companies are already turning   the protein in our poop into fertilizer for \ncrops. And all that undigested plant matter?   One Australian university has found that, when \nmixed with clay and turned into a cylinder, it’s   a good building block for, well, building blocks. \nAnd in Kenya, one organization is adding fly larva   to treated sewage. The larvae eat the fat in our \npoop and grow up to 10 times in size, turning   into delicious insect nuggets that can be used by \nfarmers to in turn fatten up their chickens and   pigs. And oh yeah, one sewage treatment plant \nin Japan was able to mine those heavy metals   from our poop. In fact, for every ton of poop in \ntheir facility, they were able to reclaim about 2   kilograms of gold – presumably because the workers \nat nearby precision equipment manufacturers were   inadvertently ingesting lots of the metal.\nSo yeah, once we get rid of the tiny dangerous   pathogen slice of our poop pie, every \nremaining slice can in principle be reused,   and in even more ways than we’ve mentioned \nhere. We humans poop out about 300 billion   kilos of poop every year. If we can make \nit safe, a buttload of opportunities await. Speaking of poop, let’s talk about your \ncell phone bill. If it’s anything like mine,   it's turdally too expensive, which stinks. \nBut Mint Mobile –our partners on this video–   can freshen that up for you. Mint offers all of \nthe features you want – speed, coverage, data,   and unlimited talk and text on the U.S’s largest \n5G network –and none of the crap you don’t– for   as little as $15 a month. It works just like \nmy old service – I can still watch ridiculous   YouTube videos, listen to true crime podcasts, \nand read about the toilets of the future –all   at a fraction of the cost. Mint keeps costs \nlow by selling direct online – and if you’re   already using another service, you can flush it \nand switch over to Mint in just 15 minutes.Go   to trymintmobile.com/minuteearth to activate the \ndeal, or just click the link in the description."

    "content": "do we need nuclear energy to stop climate change more and more voices from science environmental activists and the Press have been saying so in recent years but this comes as a shock to those who are fighting against nuclear energy and the problems that come with it so who's right well it's complicated to slow rapid climate change the world needs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to Net Zero in 2018 3 of global emissions were released through energy production namely by burning fossil fuels energy is a broad term that describes all sorts of stuff from moving things and people around to putting things big and small together or heating our homes currently 84% of the world's primary energy comes from fossil fuels 33% from oil 27% from coal and 24% from gas around 10% of the global oil supply is just used to burn in boilers to make our homes cozy and warm only about 16% of global energy is from low emission sources almost 7% from hydroelectric 5% from solar wind bioenergy wave tidal and geothermal combined and about 4% from nuclear so we pretty much rely on coal oil and gas to keep our civilization going which means it's actually very hard to transition away from them to have a chance of escaping fossil fuels without throwing Humanity back into the Stone Age one of the most impactful things we can do is to Electrify as many sectors as possible electricity is the stuff that appears like magic when you plug something into a socket so you can watch YouTube Every industry that can switch from burning fossil fuels to electricity needs to do so from electric cars to electric heaters why do we need to bet so hard on electricity because we can prod produce electricity with low emission Technologies like solar wind or Nuclear So electricity is a real lever for a radical transition but there are a few problems making this transition really hard first of all in most places in the world electricity is still generated mostly by burning fossil fuels and not only that in the last 20 years the world's electricity usage increased 73% in absolute terms while we are installing Renewables at record speeds at the same time the amount of fossil fuel we're burning for electricity still keeps Rising year by year Renewables have so far not been able to catch up with the demand for new electricity and so despite our progress emissions from electricity are still Rising worldwide the other alternative to fossil fuels is nuclear and even though it's not renewable its greenhouse gas emissions are tiny compared to burning stuff but in the last 20 years nuclear has basically stagnated countries like China India and South Korea built new reactors while Germany and Japan have been actively taking their nuclear plants offline which seems a bit weird if we look at the countries with the most low carbon electricity in the world that get most of their juice mainly from two sources nuclear or hydrop power take France and Sweden in France only around 10% comes from fossil fuel fuels while 67% comes from nuclear and 23% from Renewables primarily Hydro in Sweden almost 30% comes from nuclear power and about 45% from Hydro so we know that nuclear energy can work at scale on the technical side because of the lack of investment and innovation in the last few decades the majority of the world's nuclear reactors are pretty old technology that's very costly to replace in most Western countries build in nuclear reactors has become very expensive for a variety of reasons like a loss of knoow in constructing them policy changes and increased regulatory constraints so it can take a decade or longer just to finish a power plant in contrast countries like South Korea China India and Russia are able to build new nuclear reactors comparatively quickly and at a competitive cost still generally in the west the current generation of nuclear power plants are more expensive to build and maintain than most most fossil fuel Alternatives there are also the concerns about nuclear waste and the fear of accidents but we cover those in other videos in more detail we have designs for nuclear reactors that solve many of their problems namely small reactors that take less time and money to get started there are also next Generation technologies that can already turn radioactive waste into new fuel but so far these have not been deployed at a scale where they can have a significant impact on the nuclear SE considering these uncertainties some argue that nuclear power is a dangerous relic of the past and that we should just let it go and focus on Renewables but while Renewables undoubtedly are the future of electricity they still have their own huge challenges to overcome before they can take over the vast majority of the electricity gr the main problem is reliability and consistency it's not always windy and the sun doesn't always shine especially in the morning and evenings when humans need the most electricity the variations between Seasons don't make this issue easier to make Renewables reliable and not risk blackouts we need massive storage capacities where we can save energy collected when the sun or wind are at their Peak and release it later when we actually need it until this is possible other sources of electricity need to provide a controllable load that creates the reliability of Supply that our civilization needs to run properly eventually we will be able to do this with Renewables but we need a lot of batteries or storage power plants right now we simply don't have the tech and the capacities to make this transition fast enough to replace fossil fuels but even if we could there's another aspect we have to take into account we're not just trying to kick fossil fuels out of electricity we're trying to replace energy with electricity if we're going to to Electrify sectors that currently use fossil fuels like cars or heating we will need significantly more electricity than we're currently using everywhere around the world and if the electricity needs of the world population continue to grow as they have over the last 20 years we'll need even more it all comes down to one thing no energy source is perfect all have their own unique problems both Renewables and nuclear energy require time investment and technological Innovation on their own neither is ready to remove fossil fuels from our electricity grit although activists on both sides claim that they are in the end the question is how we want to deal with all these challenges should we give up nuclear immediately and at least temporarily accept higher emissions will we try to extend the life of current nuclear reactors and shut them down afterwards while solving the shortcomings of Renewables or will we invest in new nuclear technology to get new nuclear reactor types that are cheaper and safer or will we maybe do both opinion part starts here considering the risks the climate change poses for the biosphere and Humanity any technology that has a chance of contributing to a solution should be pursued that's just good risk management and strategy if preventing rapid climate change as quickly as possible is our goal it might be a good idea to see nuclear and Renewables not as opponents but as partners we know there's no time to waste so we should keep all of our low emission players on the field as things are both nuclear and Renewables need Innovation and investment but if we don't know yet which technology will be ready how quickly why not just invest in both and see what happens and on the topic of current capacities if we take nuclear energy offline right now then that missing capacity will be replaced at least partially by fossil fuels even if new nuclear power plants in the west are expensive in the long run it may be cheaper to build them as long as they prevent more fossil fuel capacity being added and paying for the consequences of Rapid climate change so do we need nuclear energy well it really depends how hard we choose to make things for ourselves and in a world that's already having a really hard time quitting fossil fuels why why should we make things harder than necessary"

    "content": "our home is burning rapid climate change is destabilizing our world it seems our emissions will not fall quickly enough to avoid runaway warming and we may soon hit tipping points that will lead to the collapse of ecosystems and our civilization while scientists activists and much of the younger generation urge action it appears most politicians are not committed to doing anything meaningful while the fossil fuel industry still works actively against change it seems Humanity can't overcome its greed and obsession with short-term profit and personal gain to save itself and so for many the future looks grim and hopeless young people feel particularly anxious and depressed instead of looking ahead to a lifetime of opportunity they wonder if they will even have a future or if they should bring kids into this world it's an age of Doom and hopelessness and giving up seems the only sensible thing to do but that's not true you are not doomed humanity is not [Music] doomed despite the seriousness of the situation for years positive Trends have accumulated and there is finally some good news and a clear path towards our Collective climate goals Welcome to our Ted Talk please watch this video to the end check out our detailed sources afterwards to learn learn more okay let's start with the scariest things cancelling the apocalypse some of the most widely shared stories about climate change are that it is an existential threat the end of human civilization and maybe even our own Extinction event and that it's basically unavoidable now but what does science actually say as of 20122 the global average temperature has risen 1.2 de C compared to pre-industrial times limiting warming to 1.5° was the most ambitious goal of the Paris agreement but we are not likely to meet it already with the warming we have today hot places will get hotter wet places wetter and the risk and strength of extreme weather events increase significantly warming Beyond 2° makes all of these extremes more extreme extreme weather events more common with more ecosystems under major pressure some will not survive at 3° significant parts of Earth especially in developing countries might become unable to feed their populations heat waves will become a major Global issue large scale natural systems will break down the scale and frequency of hurricans fires and droughts will further increase and cause trillions in damage poor regions and subsistence farmers will be hit the hardest hundreds of millions of people will need to leave their homes in the 4 to 8° range the apocalypse begins the hot house Earth where things change so quickly that it may become unable to support our large human population and billions May perish leaving the rest on a hostile Alien Planet a decade ago for lack of action and perspective many scientists assumed a four plus degree world was our future and a lot of Public Communication focused on exactly this Future Path luckily it's much less likely that this version of the Apocalypse will come to pass if current climate policies stagnate we're likely to end up with warming of around 3° C by 2,100 which is scary and tragic and far from acceptable but this is actually good news how in the last decade we've seen enough progress that most scientists now think that we have likely avoided apocalyptic climate change although substantial risk Still Remains we can pretty confidently say that Humanity isn't going anywhere civilization might have to change but it will endure which begs the question what has changed over the last 10 years and is this really good news the invisible shift you probably know this story the last decade has been an immense failure for climate policies around the world instead of passing comprehensive binding bills that would meaningfully reduce emissions we mostly did nothing a loss decade with one negative record after another and this story is true as and it's one reason why so many people are giving up but it is not the whole picture despite the lack of climate policies and ongoing lobbying and misinformation campaigns from the fossil fuel Industries there was a lot of progress let's go back 20 years to see why today is so different between 2000 and 2010 greenhouse gas emissions had grown by 24% three times as much as the increase in the previous decade subsidies for fossil fuels aimed at promoting economic growth caused a colossal increase in their consumption for developing countries like China and India coal was the cheapest fuel for growth while rich countries showed little interest in changing their ways in 2010 many people expected these Trends to continue instead of decreasing fossil fuel use its consumption would rise the next decade turned out to be very different though first of all coal burning in developing countries like India has slowed down or leveled off like in China and it's plummeted in rich countries like the UK and us since 2015 34s of planned coal plants have been canceled and 44 countries have committed to stop building them 10 years ago that would have seemed like wishful thinking but today we can say with confidence coal is dying it's just not competitive anymore because Technologies we thought would remain expensive matured rapidly instead renewable electricity has shown explosive progress in a mere decade wind energy got three times cheaper solar electricity is now 10 times cheaper cheaper than coal or any other fossil fuel burning power plant despite the massive subsidies and Global infrastructure propping up fossil fuels 25 times more solar and nearly five times more wind electricity is produced today compared with 10 years ago which is of course not nearly enough one of the biggest obstacles is the variability of their power output renew need a lot of energy storage to be a reliable power source like expensive batteries amazingly battery prices have decreased by 97% in the past 30 years 60% in the last decade alone which will serve all kinds of Green Technology like electric cars you might say well that's great but didn't kot kazak's last climate video say that while wind and solar are nice we need nothing less than a fundamental transition of our Global industrial system yes but luckily the shift goes beyond just the energy sector throughout the economy people are working on improving current technology to lower emissions we're rapidly replacing old incandescent light bulbs with LEDs that are 10 times more efficient in 2020 about 7 out of 10 new cars in Norway were electric or hybrid in 2021 it was already eight out of 10 and the list goes on from electric heating and better insulation to ships traveling at half speed to save fuel wherever you look you find scientists engineers and entrepreneurs trying to solve some aspect of climate change enormous amounts of human Ingenuity are being brought to bear on this problem with more and more people deciding to prioritize preventing rapid climate change solutions for low carbon production of cement electronics and steel and Innovations like artificial meat and carbon capture are in the works the more of these Technologies we deploy the cheaper new and better technology gets the cheaper they get the more people use them and so on we can see the impact already the domestic CO2 output of rich countries is falling without a major recession since the year 2000 the EU as a whole shows a 21% decrease Italy 28% the UK 35% Denmark 43% but the best news may be that emissions are no longer necessarily coupled with the economic growth in the past this Was An Inconvenient Truth to get richer you had to emit more which led to Fierce arguments between developing and developed countries about the fairness of reducing emissions while their populations were still poor but in the last decade we've seen that it is possible to increase Prosperity without increasing emissions emissions in the Czech Republic dropped 13% while their GDP grew by 27% France reduced their CO2 emissions by 14% while increasing GDP by 15% Romania saw an 8% decrease and 35 5% growth and even the largest economy on Earth the USA decreased emissions by 4% while growing their GDP by 26% some of you may call this a numbers trick that rich countries are just exporting emissions to poorer Nations by moving the dirty parts of their economies like manufacturing but even when we account for all of our imported goods the numbers still look positive it's no longer a matter of having to choose between prosperity and the climate as it seemed to be a decade ago developing countries will profit from that because as rich countries pay for the expensive development of green technologies they can adopt them more cheaply they can skip most of the high emission phase that today's rich countries went through we are at the point where not decarbonizing is a bad business decision and we haven't even really talked about Solutions like carbon capture in 2000 it didn't really exist in 2022 that technology does exist and costs around $600 to remove one ton of CO2 from the atmosphere as investment pours in and the technology matures and begins to scale it's likely that these costs will plummet over the next few decades so everything's fine then well let's not get carried away all of these processes are great but not nearly fast enough we're still doing way too little and Technology will not magically solve everything we need to use fewer resources and use them longer design consumer goods that are repairable and durable and decrease our energy requirements we need much better infrastructure Agriculture and cities it will still be hard work especially to get the right policies passed and enacted but for the first time ever there are a few trend lines pointing solidly in the right direction and now imagine if all of this was achieved without proper financial and political support and despite fossil fuel lobbying just think what Humanity can do when climate change finally gets the political attention and funding it needs so is it okay to feel hopeful again the situation is still dire and serious so what's the point of focusing on this side of the story The Trap of hopelessness climate change can feel overwhelming and make your future seem Bleak the sadness and hopelessness that many people feel is real and very destructive because it causes apathy apathy that is only serving the fossil fuel industry that is still delaying change however it can in a sense they have weaponized hopelessness we are now in phase four in the public debate about rapid climate change action phase one was climate change is not real phase two was climate change is real but not caused by humans phase three was climate change may be caused by humans but it's not that bad phase four is climate change is no longer avoidable we are doomed and it doesn't matter what we do if we want the World to Change we first need to believe that change is possible and we have an abundance of evidence that it is changes to our industrial system are gaining momentum technology gets better and cheaper climate change has become a key issue in most free elections as more and more younger people move into influential positions they prioritize climate change and work on new Solutions in 2022 most governments not only acknowledge it but set their own Net Zero goals in Democratic and autocratic countries the results of years of fighting a steep uphill battle are now clearly visible the pressure needs to keep increasing to make sure that the promises made today are actually kept climate doomeris is the equivalent of giving up even though you can still prevent not just the worst case but also mitigate most of the bad things make changes in time to adapt better and prevent the poorest from suffering that is why hopelessness and apathy are so dangerous if the last in any ways wasted decade has shown anything then it's that progress is being made and that dire scenarios are just predictions not our sealed fate as of 2022 based on current Global policies we will end up in a 3° world now it's our job to yet again prove the predictions wrong despite how serious and urgent things are to turn that 3° into a two de and then see where we can go from there for that we need hope and we hope we gave you that today at least a little that you feel that things are serious but also that you have a future that you could have kids without dooming them or the world that taking action today is worth it and that despite powerful Industries doing everything to delay it Society is changing if you need a more concrete road mapap of what you can do personally we're working on a follow-up video to talk about that in Greater detail weaponized hopelessness are the only Trump cards left for the powers that don't want change don't let them win [Music]"

    "content": "Since the Industrial Revolution, humans have released over 1.5 trillion tons of carbon dioxide or CO₂, into the Earth's atmosphere. In the year 2019, we were still pumping out around 37 billion more. That's 50 percent more than the year 2000 and almost three times as much as 50 years ago. And it's not just CO₂, we're also pumping out growing volumes of other greenhouse gases such as methane and nitrous oxide. Combining all of our greenhouse gases, we're emitting 51 billion tons of carbon dioxide equivalents each year. And emissions keep rising. But they need to get down to zero. In recent years, the consequences have become more serious and visible. Almost every year breaks some horrible record: We've had more heat waves, the most glaciers melting, and the lowest amount of ice ever recorded at the North Pole. Of the last 22 years, 20 have been the hottest on record. The only way to limit this rapid climate change is to decrease our collective emissions quickly. But although all countries agree on this goal in principle, they do not agree who is responsible or who should bear the heaviest load. The developed countries point at their own efforts to reduce emissions and the fact that the large developing countries on the rise, especially China, are currently releasing much more CO₂. On the other hand, developing countries argue that emissions by the West are lifestyle emissions, while for developing countries, they are survival emissions. Others call rich countries hypocrites that got rich by polluting without restraint and now expect others not to industrialize and stay poor. So who is responsible for climate change and CO₂ emissions? And regardless of the past, who needs to do the most today? In this video, we'll talk exclusively about nation-states. We'll look at the fossil fuel industry in another video. Question 1 of 3: Which countries emit the most carbon dioxide today? In 2017, humans emitted about 36 billion tons of CO₂. More than 50% came from Asia. North America and Europe followed with 18% and 17%. While Africa, South America, and Oceania together only contributed eight percent. China is by far the world's largest emitter with 10 billion tons of CO₂ every year, or 27% of global emissions. It's followed by the USA with 15% and the European Union with around 10%. Together, this is more than half of the world's CO₂ emissions. So it's clear that without the willingness and action of these three industrial blocs, humanity will not be able to become carbon neutral and prevent severe climate change. Next on our list is India at seven percent, Russia at five percent, Japan at three percent, and Iran, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, and Canada all just short of two percent. Together with the first three, the top 10 are responsible for 75% of global emissions. But if we only look at the current situation, we're not getting the full picture. Question 2 of 3: Which countries have emitted the most in total? If we look at emissions throughout history until today, the outlook changes drastically. The US and the EU both knock China off the top spot. The US is responsible for 25% of the world's historical emissions emitting 400 billion tons, mostly in the 20ᵗʰ century. In second place is the EU at 22%. China comes in third at just under 13 percent, around half of the USA's contribution. India's contribution shrinks to 3 percent along with the whole of Africa and South America. The UK is responsible for one percent of annual global emissions but takes five percent of the historical responsibility. Germany, producing two percent of emissions per year today, has contributed almost six percent, as much as the whole of Africa and South America combined. So the narrative that rapid climate change is really the responsibility of the developing world is hard to defend if facts matter to you. But this is still not the whole story, because focusing on countries mixes two things: population numbers and total emissions. If a country has more people in general, its emissions are of course higher. Things look very different if we look at individuals like you, dear viewer. Question 3 of 3: Which countries emit the most carbon dioxide per person? The average human is responsible for around five tons of CO₂ each year, but averages can be misleading. The countries with the largest CO₂ emissions per person are some of the world's major oil and gas producers. In 2017, Qatar had the highest emissions at a hefty 49 tons per person, followed by Trinidad and Tobago, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Brunei, Bahrain, and Saudi Arabia. But those are outliers. Australians have one of the highest carbon footprints per person: 17 tons a year. That's more than triple the global average and slightly more than the average US American and Canadian at 16 tons. The Germans do a little better at close to 10 tons, but this is still twice the global average. China may be the world's largest emitter, but it's also the world's most populous country with over 1.4 billion people, 18.5% of the world population. Per person, it's above average at seven tons. Historically, CO₂ emissions have been closely tied to a high standard of living. Wealth is one of the strongest indicators of our carbon footprint, because as we move from poor to rich, we gain access to electricity, heating, air conditioning, lighting, modern cooking, cars or planes, smartphones, computers, and interact with people across the world online. The enormous rise of China's CO₂ emissions is coupled with the greatest reduction of poverty in history. If we order CO₂ emissions by income, we see that the richest half of countries are responsible for 86% of global emissions and the bottom half for only 14%. The average German emits more than five times as much as the average Indian. In just 2.3 days, the average American emits as much as the average Nigerian in a year. And not only that, the harsh reality is that it's the countries that contribute least to the problem that stand to lose the most from rapid climate change. The developing world will be hit the hardest. The consequences could be food insecurity, conflicts over resources, harsher and more frequent natural disasters, and large climate refugee movements. Question 4... of 3: So who should take responsibility? Many of today's richest countries are in a convenient position. They have become rich over centuries of fossil fuel burning and industrial production. They have a large historical footprint, and their wealth means they still emit a lot per person. But their country's annual emissions are now dwarfed by other countries, because the giant that is China is finally catching up, and other giants like India are on their way. Many Germans, for example, wonder how if Germany only accounts for two percent of yearly emissions, it can have a meaningful impact on reducing emissions. The answer is simple. For one, the richest countries have the resources, highly educated workforces, and technology to develop low-cost, low-carbon solutions and spread them around the world. If we don't want poorer countries to become as fossil fuel-dependent as we are, we need low-carbon technology to be cheap and available. And we're getting there. The cost of renewables is falling quickly and a variety of solutions are on the horizon for many different sectors. But it needs to happen much faster. If the rich countries of the West decide to seriously tackle rapid climate change, the rest of the world would follow, because it has no choice. Just like when the European Union enforced energy efficiency standards for technology, the rest of the world adopted them too, because they wanted to be able to continue trading with the block. Still, this doesn't absolve others of their responsibility. China is the largest CO₂ emitter today, and it's China's responsibility to grow in a way that will make it possible to transition to a zero-carbon world in time. Others acting irresponsibly yesterday is a horrible excuse for repeating the same mistakes today. Climate change is a global problem, and no country alone can fix it. Working out who's responsible is not as simple as it seems, and in a way, it's a daft question, but one that has plagued international politics for decades. In the end, it's pretty simple. Everybody needs to do the best they can, and right now we are all not doing that. But we can begin today. This video is part of a series about climate change supported by Breakthrough Energy, a coalition founded by Bill Gates that's working to expand clean energy investment and support the innovations that will lead the world to net zero carbon emissions. Also, a special thanks to the team at Our World in Data for helping us out with data and research. [Calm outro music]"

    "content": "Never before in human history have we been\nricher, more advanced or powerful. And yet we feel overwhelmed in the face of\nrapid climate change. It seems simple on the surface. Greenhouse gases trap energy from the Sun\nand transfer it to our atmosphere. This leads to warmer winters, harsher summers. Dry places become drier and wet places wetter. Countless ecosystems will die while the rising\noceans swallow coasts and the cities we build on them. So why don’t we just like… prevent all\nof that? Well, it’s complicated. The public debate about stopping rapid climate\nchange often focuses on a few key features, like coal plants, cars or burping cows. And so the solutions are often simplistic\n– rows of solar panels, biking to work, something something sustainability. And a huge talking point is personal responsibility. How YOU should change your lifestyle to prevent\nrapid climate change, which we will find out together in the next few minutes. This is one of those videos where we want\nto encourage you to watch to the end, because to discuss real doable solutions, we first\nneed to understand  the problem. A Fuller Picture Modern industrial society as we constructed\nit in the last 150 years, is inherently destructive to the planet. Basically everything we do to make our lives\neasier, safer and more comfortable is making things worse for the biosphere. The food we eat, the streets we walk on, the\nclothes we wear, the gadgets we use, the way we move around and the pleasant temperatures\nwe artificially create around us. While most people know about the serious impact\nof energy, beef, cars and planes, many major polluters are barely ever talked about. The emissions leaking out of landfills are\nas significant as the emissions of all the jets in the air. More CO2 is released to run our homes than\nfrom all cars combined. And the emissions produced when making a new\ncar is equivalent to building just two metres of road. So it is nice to switch to electric cars but\nthey won’t solve anything if we keep building roads the same way. Fixing one small part of the industrial system\nis not enough. Each of the many different parts needs its\nown solution and many of them aren’t straight forward. But even where we know what to do, just because\na solution exists doesn’t mean we are able or willing to implement it. There are many gray areas in the fight against\nrapid climate change, the most prominent one is the divide between rich and poor. Emissions vs poverty There is a clear connection between the prosperity\nof a nation and its carbon emissions. In other words, richer people tend to cause\nmore emissions. So the key to fixing climate change is simply\nfor the world’s richest to cut back on their extravagant lifestyles right? While this would help, it wouldn’t make\nthe problem go away. This is because 63% of global emissions come\nfrom low to middle income countries. Countries where most people are not living\nextravagantly but are trying to escape poverty at worst, and achieve a comfortable lifestyle\nat best. The unfortunate reality is that, currently,\nescaping poverty and becoming middle class creates unavoidable emissions. So asking developing countries to cut emissions\njust looks like an attempt to keep them down. It is very hard to argue that a region should\nprotect their primeval forests and spend money on solar panels instead of burning wood, when\nit can’t meet basic needs for significant parts of its population. So, cutting back is not a popular demand,\nespecially if the countries making these demands got rich by causing environmental damage in\nthe past. For billions of people, more emissions are\na good thing personally. When we forget about this, we tend to propose\nunworkable solutions. Take concrete. 8% of CO2 emissions are released by the concrete\nmanufacturing industry. Ok cool, stop using concrete, right? But right now, concrete is also a cheap and\neasy way for growing populations in developing countries to build affordable housing. And there are many examples like that. Even rich countries aren’t immune from disagreeing\nabout rapid climate change solutions. Banning coal, gas and oil from the energy\nmix is slowed down by heated discussions about what should replace them. Citizens can be strictly against nuclear power\nbut also oppose wind or solar infrastructure in their backyards. In principle all of these issues can be overcome\n– but there are things we don’t currently know how to overcome. The most problematic one is food. Emit or Die We will soon need to feed 10 billion people,\nand we don’t know how to do that without emitting greenhouse gases. Because of the nature of modern food production\nthat requires fertilizers or manure, it is impossible to have zero-emissions food. Rice alone emits so much methane each year\nthat it practically equals the emissions of all the air traffic in the world. What’s worse is that the foods we like the\nmost emit the most. 57% of food emissions come from animal-based\nfoods, although they make up only 18% of the world’s calories, and 37% of its protein. And as people across the world grow richer,\nthey want more meat. Traditional diets in most cultures were primarily\nplant based with a little meat on top. But with the rise of industrial style meat\nproduction and factory farming, meat has become a staple food; a regular indulgence in developed\ncountries and a symbol of status and wealth in developing countries. Today about 40 percent of the world’s habitable\nland is used for meat production in some form or another, the size of North and South America\ncombined. This is land on which we could otherwise allow\nnative ecosystems to regrow, like forests in the Amazon, and suck carbon out of the\natmosphere, but instead most of it is used to feed animals. The available solutions are uniquely able\nto make everybody on the political spectrum, rich or poor, unhappy. Meat is highly emotional and there are a lot\nof whataboutism arguments floating around, like comparing it to the worst sources of\nemissions. In the end it is pretty simple: eating less\nmeat alone won’t stop climate change, but we also can’t stop climate change without\neating less meat. The same holds true for other things that\nare less crucial to our survival but frankly not realistic to make go away. Like air travel, oversea shipping, mining\nand the production of devices that play youtube videos. So what does this mean? Do we need to give up our way of life and\ncan the poor never achieve it? Can’t some technology save us so we can\ncontinue to drive our big cars and eat meat every day? Solutions vs Expenses In principle, this technology already exists:\nDirect Air Capture of CO2 draws carbon dioxide from the air so that it can be stored underground\nor transformed into products. So why aren’t we implementing it in every\nindustry, everywhere? Because with the technology we have right\nnow, this would cost some ten trillion dollars per year, or half the United States’ GDP. This money has to come from somewhere and\ncurrently no-one is offering it. Just dumping these costs on massive polluters\nlike steel mills and coal power stations would double the cost of their products – and\nso these industries that operate on very tight profit margins would go bankrupt. Getting the government to pay for it seems\nlogical but a lot of state resources are actually tied up doing the opposite, like subsidizing\noil and gas. Which seems counter intuitive but follows\nclear incentives. By artificially keeping fuel prices low, shipping\nand everyday goods are kept artificially cheap too. Which has a major social impact on billions\nof people around the world. That creates political lobbies and incentives\nthat perpetuate this cycle that makes it so hard to cut off fossil fuel production. Meanwhile, very costly solutions for a far-off\nproblem like carbon capture seem like they can wait, as technically nobody benefits from\nit right now. Some argue that a move away from capitalism\nis the only solution to this mess, others insist that markets should be even freer,\nwithout any interventions like subsidies and some suggest that we need what’s referred\nto as “degrowth” and to cut back as a species overall. But the truth is at least as of now, no political\nsystem is doing an impressive job at becoming truly sustainable and none have really done\nso in the past. We also don’t have the time to figure this\nout and do a lot of experiments. We must implement solutions now. Not just to halt the release of all possible\ngreenhouse gases, but also to start reducing the amount of CO2 in the air. It’s too late to just mend our ways, we\nhave to actively correct our past mistakes. With every year we waste, more extreme changes\nwill be unavoidable. Ok. Let’s take a deep breath. Rapid climate change and the world we live\nin are complicated. So here is where YOU, dear viewer, come in\nagain. Could YOU please fix the climate? A narrative of our time is that we are all\nresponsible for rapid climate change. That everyone needs to play their part. Why don’t you buy a new electric car? Why don’t you replace your gas stove with\nan electric one? How about you double glaze your windows, stop\neating meat and switch off your lights? Shifting responsibility from the largest carbon\nemitters to the average person, you, is much easier to do than solving problems. There’s an extra bonus if solving rapid\nclimate change sells a new product. If you don’t have the money or time for\nthese things, you should feel bad. It’s an effective message because it is\ntrue. The quickest way to cut CO2 emissions would\nbe if all rich populations on Earth drastically changed their lifestyles and if the people\non the rise would not seek to achieve it. Favouring the climate over comfort and wealth. If you are able to watch this video, this\nincludes you. But we’ve just witnessed a global experiment\nin staying at home, not using transport and consuming less during the coronavirus pandemic. And all it did was reduce CO2 emissions by\n7% for 2020. Asking average people to solve rapid climate\nchange breaks down when we look at the scale of the problem. Personal contributions toward reducing greenhouse\ngas emissions are nice, but they are dwarfed by the systemic reality of global emissions. The concept of your personal carbon footprint\nwas popularized by the oil producer BP in a 2005 ad campaign. Arguably one of the most effective and sinister\npieces of propaganda that still seriously distracts all of us from the reality of the\nsituation. If you eliminated 100% of your emissions for\nthe rest of your life, you would save one second’s worth of emissions from the global\nenergy sector. Even the most motivated person can’t even\nmake a tiny dent. When we put together the dangers of rapid\nclimate change, the scale of emissions and the lack of consensus over how to solve it,\nthe challenge seems insurmountable. It can cause decision fatigue and moral licensing,\nwhere you no longer feel bad about behaving in a counter productive way. We have struggled a long time with this, which\nis why this video took us so long to make. So. What can you actually do? There are many different takes and they are\npassionately discussed. We don’t know who is right, so we can only\noffer you the Kurzgesagt perspective and opinion. Opinion Part: What can you ACTUALLY do? We need a different way to think and talk\nabout rapid climate change. An all-encompassing systemic approach, nothing\nless than changing the fundamentals of our modern industrial societies. As discussed in frustrating length, the personal\nresponsibility angle is overplayed. For systemic changes in technology, politics\nand the economy of this magnitude, we need to influence the people at the levers. Politicians need to know and feel strongly\nthat the people care, that their own success depends on tackling rapid climate change. When governments and local politicians are\nreluctant to change laws that affect their biggest tax contributors or campaign donors,\nwe need to vote them out and vote in people who respect science. We need to hold them accountable for implementing\nthe most effective climate change strategies. Not waste our time with things like banning\nplastic straws but by moving the big levers: Food, transportation and energy while not\nforgetting the smaller ones like cement or construction. When industries fight against changing their\nways, for fear of losses or in an honest attempt to protect their own, we need politicians\nto change the laws and incentivise the deployment of existing technologies and massively invest\nin innovation for the fields where we don’t have great solutions yet. There is no reason that the profit interests\nof industries could not match the need to reduce carbon emissions as much as possible. And if they still don’t cooperate harsh\npunishments and regulation need to force or bankrupt them. It's still unrealistic that change of that\nscope can be forced onto a worldwide economy quickly enough, because many low carbon technologies\nstill need a lot of time and research – which means they are expensive. But more companies will make more efficient\ncarbon capture systems, tasty meat alternatives, better batteries, cement alternatives and\nso on, if there is a clear and growing demand. And if you are affluent enough, you can do\nyour part by investing in these things right now while they're still expensive. These are the mechanisms that will drive the\nprices down later on. So this is basically what you can do. Vote at the ballot, vote with your wallet. There are too many opposing interests and\ncomplicated grey zones. In the end if we truly get the systemic change\nwe need, everybody will be unhappy about some aspect of it. Only if we all accept that some solutions\nwill have negative impacts for us, can we have an honest conversation and make progress. Everybody will be a little unhappy. And that is ok. This is the best you can do. You can deal with the reality of the situation\nand promote your priorities through your behaviour and your actions. And while you do so, you can eat less meat,\nfly less or get an electric car. Not because you should feel guilty if you\ndon’t or because you naively believe that you alone can stop rapid climate change – but\nto do your tiny, tiny part for the systemic change we need.

    "content": "Climate change is just too much. There's never any good news. Only graphs that get more and more red and angry. Almost every year breaks some horrible record, from the harshest heat waves to the most rapid glacier melt. It's endless, and relentless. We've known for decades that rapid climate change has been caused by the release of greenhouse gases. But instead of reducing them, in 2019 the world was emitting 50% more CO₂ than in the year 2000. And emissions are still rising. Why is that? Why is it so hard to just stop emitting these gases? Our collective CO₂ emissions can be expressed as a product of four factors and their relationship with each other. Two of them explain why worldwide CO₂ emissions are still rising, and two explain how we can stop that. Population Size, Economic Growth, Energy Intensity, and Emissions pere Energy unit produced. Number 1: Population Size People need food, homes, and clothing. And they demand luxury products from iPhones to one dollar cheeseburgers more people = higher CO₂ emissions. It's a very simple equation. The global population is growing, and according to the UN it will level off at about 11 billion in 2100, which is 40% more than today. The only way to slow down this growth is investment in healthcare, and access to contraception and education in developing countries. But even with massive investment, it will take a few decades for the effects of lower birthrates to manifest themselves, so the global population will keep growing for the foreseeable future, and, as a consequence, global CO₂ emissions rise over the next few decades. Number 2: Growth, or \"Getting Richer\". But it's not just about our numbers, The richer and more developed we are, the more emissions our lifestyle produces. A programmer in the US has a higher CO₂ footprint than 50 farmers in Uganda. The world's wealth is growing almost everywhere. And although it's far from easily distrubuted, economic growth has led to the highest standards of living, and the largest reduction in extreme poverty in human history. Growth has become the dominant mantra of the world's economies, no matter what kind of political system they have. It's unlikely that rich countries will give up the concept of growth any time soon. But even if they were to, developing countries want to become rich too For billions of people, the end of growth would probably mean staying poor and so developing countries are not willing to stop growing their economies. All in all, we can agree that growth as a guiding economic ideology is not going to go away any time soon. More countries and their citizens around the world will grow and become richer while the rich economies will continue to grow their wealth. There are some signs that growth can be decoupled from CO₂ emissions but we're not close to that yet. As a consequence of this growth, CO₂ emissions will rise. Ok, so far we've learned that because of population growth and economic growth, humanity's CO₂ emissions will increase. ...which is the opposite of what should be happening. We need to slow, peak, and then reduce annual emissions. The next two factors describe how we can actually do this. Number 3: Energy Intensity Energy intensity describes how efficiently we use energy. A street food vendor in rural Brazil might burn coal to cook... while a street food vendor in France might use an induction stove powered by nuclear energy. The latter is way more efficient. The more efficient something is, the less energy we need to do something. Be it powering a metropolitan area, or grilling a kebab. So making our technology more efficient, and coming up with more efficient ways to organise our societies is one of the most important ways to reduce the modern world's CO₂ dependancy. This can mean everything from reducing power consumption with A.I., the electrification of the transportation and industrial sectors, or sustainable concrete production. The opportunities for improvement are almost limitless, and human ingenuity can run wild. But we know that increasing efficiency alone will not be enough, mostly for 3 reasons: 1: Direct Rebound Effects. This means that once something becomes more efficient, it's used more, and so overall, the increased efficiency does not lead to a reduction as impressive as you would first think. ...or worse, sometimes more efficiency makes humans use not *less* of a resource, but *more* of it. When planes became more fuel-efficient, ticket prices decreased, and more people started to travel by plane. So making things more efficient does not automatically mean less energy use in total. It might have the opposite effect. 2: Indirect Rebound Effects. Sometimes when you save money on a thing that becomes more efficient, you might spend it elsewhere. For example, if you buy a more fuel-efficient car, you save money on fuel, and end up with extra funds in your bank account... ...that you might spend on vacation, and take a flight with. So in the end, you might actually emit more CO₂ despite getting a more efficient car. 3: And lastly, the more you optimise for efficiency, the harder and more expensive it becomes to get more efficient. So, over time, the return on investment slows down. And, with many technologies, we are already pretty efficient. But, regardless of how efficient we make our economies, as long as we need at least some energy, we will have emissions. Efficiency alone won't create a zero-carbon world. This brings us to our last factor: Number 4: CO₂ emissions per energy unit used, or \"Our Global Carbon Footprint\". Humanity's global carbon footprint is the CO₂ released per energy unit generated. For example, coal plants release much much more CO₂ than solar power per unit of energy. This relationship is crystal clear. The more fossil fuels we burn, the higher our CO₂ output. Fossil fuels are the greatest lever humanity has right now. Of course, it's impossible to shut down coal and oil overnight without throwing society into chaos. But the reality is, that we're not doing nearly enough to keep fossil fuels in the ground and use lower-carbon alternatives We need to do 2 things to speed the transition away from fossil fuels. First, we need to use the real leverage we have today, with today's technology There are a lot of things we can do extremely quickly. We can leave nuclear power plants online longer. We can cut subsidies to the fossil fuel industry, and funnel them into renewables. We can price carbon emissions harshly, and increase the price each year to create strong incentives for the world's industries to transition. We can enforce strict standards for energy efficiency, and for any type of new construction. We can phase out fossil fuel vehicles. Next, we also need to invent new and better technology. Without new technologies and innovation, it will be impossible to achieve a zero CO₂ emission world, be it from technologies like carbon capture, or a new generation of nuclear power plants, to new batteries that revolutionise the energy storage from renewables. But innovation takes time: years, and decades... ...and we don't have this time. Every year, we keep adding more carbon to the atmosphere. This means we can't keep relying on innovation alone. We need to find ways to reduce emissions today, while we invent what we will need in the future. The less fossil fuel we burn over the next few years, the more time we give innovation to catch up. The more low-carbon energy infrastructure we build today, the more we can compensate for economic growth, and the people born today. The more coal power plants in construction we stop from being finished, the more CO₂ we save. Neither innovation, nor the alternatives we're using today alone can solve rapid climate change. But, innovation, together with a decisive move away from fossil fuels where it's possible today could do it. Solving climate change will be complicated. We have to account for the needs of billions of people and the reality that right now, society runs mostly on fossil fuels. This will not change overnight, but it needs to change as quickly as possible. And it is still very much possible🤞🏻 We'll look at different aspects of climate change, and how to solve it in more videos. Let us know what kind of stuff you want to know more about Here on YouTube, or join us in our subreddit This video is part of a series about climate change supported by Breakthrough Energy, a coalition founded by Bill Gates, that's working to expand clean energy investment and support the innovations that will lead the world to net-zero carbon emissions Also, a special thanks to the team at Our World in Data, for helping us out with data & research *quack* 🦆"

    "content": "by the end of the 21st century humanity is becoming desperate Decades of heat waves and droughts have led to unusually poor harvests while the warming oceans yield fewer fish each year in the tropical zones Millions suffer from famines and resource Wars have made Millions more flee to the north as things quickly get worse in an act of desperation the world's governments decide to enact an emergency plan it's far from certain that a grim scenario like this will play out but the failure of world leaders to effectively address climate change makes it far from impossible so in the near future it might become necessary to try something radical to slow down rapid climate change geoengineering interventions so massive in scale that they might undo centuries of human behavior or make everything much worse what is geoengineering is it really an option and what if it goes wrong [Music] geoengineering methods vary from Fantastic ones like constructing giant light sails in space to seeding clouds with salt or Wilder ones like fertilizing the oceans with iron to speed up the growth of trillions of algae cells in this video we'll focus on an intervention we could see during our lifetimes stratospheric aerosol injection a clunky term that means spraying stuff very high up in the atmosphere to keep the Sun away keeping the Sun away CO2 doesn't heat up the planet on its own almost all of the energy on Earth comes from the sun in the form of electromagnetic radiation about 71% of this energy is absorbed by the Earth's surface and atmosphere this absorbed energy is emitted again as infrared radiation and CO2 is able to trap this infrared radiation and keep it in the atmosphere for a while you can compare this effect with snuggling under a blanket in the morning even in a really cold room your body emits infrared radiation and the air between your body and the blanket traps it and creates a warm and comfy feeling so one way to cool down the planet would be to prevent energy from getting trapped under our planet blanket which is already happening naturally about 29% of the solar radiation hitting Earth is reflected back to space by bright surfaces like ice deserts snow or clouds more reflection less energy less warming we can look at nature for inspiration specifically the 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption the second largest volcanic eruption of the 20th century aside from massive Devastation and almost 900 dead scientists noted its strong impact on the global climate the explosion ejected millions of tons of particles and gas as high as the stratosphere which hung around there for a while the stuff that's interesting testing for geoengineering is sulfur dioxide a nasty smelling and invisible gas high in the atmosphere It produced a haze of sulfuric acid droplets that mixed with water and created giant veils these veils reduced the sunlight reaching Earth surface by roughly 1% global average temperatures dropped by 0.5° C it took 3 years until this cooling effect had stopped humans could imitate this process by injecting sulfur particles directly into the stratosphere According to some scientists this might be surprisingly easy to do and we don't even need a lot of new technology for it according to one study it also might be pretty cheap compared with the costs of Rapid climate change a small Fleet of specialized aircraft could Ascend once a year and distribute Aerosoles along the Equator from where they would be spread around the world projections assume that injecting between 5 and 8 megatons of material per year would reflect enough sunlight to slow down or even stop global warming giving us precious time to transition away from fossil fuels unfortunately there might be a few unhappy side effects there are a number of potential issues with aerosol injections rainfall patterns could change which could negatively affect agriculture and cause famine billions of people could be affected in the worst case also after the 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption the acid water water veils not only cooled down the surface they also heated up the stratosphere as it turns out acid is bad for the ozone layer and the ozone hole over Antarctica was the largest it has ever been injecting sulfur particles over decades could have a similar effect scientists have already suggested using a combination of different minerals that might have much less harmful effects on the ozone layer but more research and experiments need to be done to make sure this could work but even if we don't damage the ozone layer there are other risks politicians and Industry might use the cooling effect as an excuse to delay the switch to a carbon neutral economy even if geoengineering slows down global warming humanity is still adding extra CO2 to the atmosphere more CO2 in the air means that the oceans absorb more CO2 which makes them more acidic this is already beginning to be deadly to huge ecosystems like coral reefs and the longer this continues the more severe the effects will be but it gets worse once we start pumping particles into the atmosphere on a massive scale we might be forced to do so for a long time or we could risk a termination shock what that means is that if Humanity continues to enrich the atmosphere with CO2 but at the same time prevents the planet from heating up by blocking solar radiation we're sitting on a time bomb once we stop geoengineering the natural cycle will take over again and Earth would heat up but after a few Decades of keeping the planet artificial cold while still releasing massive amounts of CO2 it would heat up much much quicker an increase in temperature that would take 50 years today could happen in just 10 years such a temperature shock in such a short time would disrupt every major system on Earth so much that it would be impossible to adapt in time the worst case scenario could be dramatic famines and the rapid destruction of ecosystems Humanity might survive but the survivors would inhabit an unfamiliar and hostile world world the best case scenario is that once the world has finally fully understood the existential danger of Rapid climate change geoengineering can bu us a crucial decade or two time to transition our economies and maybe even pull CO2 out of the atmosphere maybe with technologies that we'll discuss in a future video conclusion geoengineering is a scary concept it's not a solution to climate change and it might even be a welcome excuse for the fossil fuel industry to delay the end of the fossil fuel age over the last few decades geoengineering has been so controversial that it's stopped many scientists from doing the experiments necessary to understand it better but blankly opposing geoengineering is shortsighted the sad truth is we are already running a geoengineering experiment we're testing how fast the world changes if we add about 40 billion tons of CO2 each year this experiment is about to get really exciting hopefully we'll never have to use geoengineering but if we need to in the future we better have done the science we better be prepared or a panicking Humanity might accidentally press the self-destruct [Music] button it's time to reveal our darkest secret this may come as a surprise to you but kazak is not actually run by BBS but by humans now you might wonder how's this possible so

    "content": "food is arguably the best thing about being alive no other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times every day and never gets old it's an expression of culture our parents love and a means of Celebration or Comfort that's why it hits a special nerve when we're told we should change what and how we eat to fight rapid climate change one of the most delicious foods meat gets the worst press it doesn't help that the topic is really hard to properly research yourself and that debates get emotional quickly but clearly science can give us an answer the reality is well it's complicated let's take a look at three climate arguments against meat that are used a lot and see what [Music] happens one does our diet really play that bigger role in climate change feeding billions of people is impossible without causing emissions even if someday we have zero carbon tractors refrigerators and cookers running on renewable energy and electric trucks to move our food there are still unavoidable emissions rice emits methane we cut down forests to make room for pastures and crops and we emit nitrous oxide when we use fertilizers and manure worldwide food production is responsible for about 26% of all human-made greenhouse gas emissions which is unfortunate since food is not optional while 26% doesn't sound that bad it means that even if we extinguished all other sources of emissions today the emissions from food alone would still use up our entire carbon budget by 2,100 so no matter how we twist and turn it food is a real driver of climate change still emissions from different food items vary a lot how do things look when we compare their Footprints separately food's climate impact is most often based on life cycle assessments an analysis that looks at all the emissions of a product throughout its existence from production to Transportation packaging use and waste management in the most detailed meta analysis of life cycle assessments to date beef emissions stand out at the top on average a kilogram of beef emits 71 kg of CO2 equivalent lamb is also high at 40 k pork emits 12 and poultry 10 kg at the bottom we have lots of plant-based Foods potatoes for example emit around 150 times less than beef the most important aspect of food isn't weight though it's nutrient density a kilogram of beef would keep you alive much longer than a kilogram of potatoes so how does the ranking change if we compare emissions per calorie or protein not much animal protein is still the most costly for the environment and beef and lamb are also outliers in emissions per calorie but is this Fair after all not all beef is the same there are all sorts of ways to rear cattle from Pure grass-fed to factory farming the worst beef comes in at 105 kg of emissions per 100 g of protein the best at only 9 a 10-fold difference in contrast most other Foods especially plant-based have a much narrower Spectrum still the best beef is worse than the worst plant okay but this seems promising can we buy the right beef and lower our emissions Maybe by buying locally produced beef to minimize our footprint two does buying local food actually matter let's stick with beef since it's such an outlier by buying locally you are trying to avoid emissions from transportation and packaging but it turns out these only account for 0.5 to 2% of beef's total emissions actually transport and packaging combined are only about 11% of all food emissions nearly all food transport emissions are produced over the last few miles the regional travel on the road supplying the markets and shops in your area International Food transport happens mostly on freight ships which are insanely efficient for example shipping 1 kg of avocados from South America to Europe generates about 0 0.3 kg of CO2 equivalent in transport emissions and around 2.5 kg overall while 1 kg of beef from your local butcher will come in at 18 kg in CO2 equivalence at least so even when shipped great distances emissions from almost all plant-based foods cause lower emissions than locally produced animal products okay so if transport doesn't play a big role what causes the vast amounts of emissions from beef then by far the largest share of beef emissions consists of methane released directly by The Animals while CO2 hangs around for centuries methane only stays in the atmosphere for decades but in these short periods it is very powerful all in all methane has already caused 23 to 40% of human-made warming so far there's controversy about how bad this is exactly and we don't want to Dive In Too Deep here but the way things stand any kind of extra emissions are not great still all cows burp and fart to similar degrees what explains the spectrum of beef emissions there are a couple of things it makes a difference if the beef comes from a dairy herd or one dedicated to beef production 44% of the world's beef comes from dairy cows sharing its footprint with dairy products dairy cows tend to get higher quality feed which makes them grow faster and emit less methane geography also plays a role because it determines which farming methods are possible the worst Factor by far is the destruction of forests for Farmland not only does this release the CO2 that was bound in the Flora it sets free Carbon that was stored in the soil and destroys its ability to store it in the future this aspect accounts for much of the range of emissions in beef the worst emitters are farms burning down rainforest for Farmland especially in Brazil there is a Sinister truth hidden here the more animals suffer the better they are in terms of climate change because they are way more efficient they use less land and their food is brought right to them and so they grow faster and don't expand energy on things like walking cattle in a factory farm that never get to roam pastures can sometimes be less destructive for the climate than cattle grazing peacefully on a formerly Lush piece of rainforest but isn't it a bit out of touch with reality to demonize cows so much some of the land these animals are grazing on isn't suitable for crops Anyway by grazing on pastures they can turn things we can't digest into food isn't farming animals just a smart way to make the best use of unused resources three don't cows mainly use land that we can't use for agriculture or other things about half of the world's ice and desert free land is used for agriculture an area the size of the entire Americas plus China half of all agriculturally used land is dedicated to animals most of it is grassland 65% of which cannot be converted to cropland so pasturing animals is actually a very efficient way to use those areas since we can't grow human food there anyway there are a couple of catches here though while the idea of cows turning useless grass into steak is nice it is part of a marketing lie even though it is so massive pasture land alone can't support the ruminant living on it globally grazing systems sustain only 133% of beef production so if we were to switch to 100% grass-fed we'd simply have to eat much less beef in the US beef production would crash by some 70% if it were to exclusively rely on grass the only way to sustain our high demand for meat is by growing crops and feeding them to our cattle and we haven't even talked about chicken and pig which exclusively eat feed crops because of this feed demand less than half of the world's cereals are used directly as human food 41% is fed to animals the same is true for soy there's a lot of talk about Amazon deforestation for soy production which makes us think of soy milk and tofu but only 19% of global soy production goes towards products for humans about 77% is used to feed animals besides land without food crops isn't automatically ecologically useless a beefree diet would free up around 2 billion hectares a vegan diet would free up around 3 billion hectares of land we could use this land to grow forests or restore wild grasslands basically anything that could suck carbon out of the atmosphere if we sped 3 billion hectares of land it could remove about 8 billion tons of CO2 from the air per year by comparison we emit about 50 billion tons of CO2 equivalent per year at the moment that means we could save 16% of emissions by eating a vegan diet okay to summarize food is a huge driver of emissions meat but especially beef is the worst food in terms of emissions buying locally does not have a big impact on food emissions compared to the type of food you're consuming when it comes to Beef Cattle that are grass-fed can sometimes even be counterproductive because they just need much more land even if you find the most environmentally friendly beef in the world your burger still comes with a significantly higher carbon footprint than a veggie patty you can decide for yourself what you want to do with this information"

    "content": "The ocean conveyor belt and\nthe Gulf Stream. Ocean currents have a direct\ninfluence on our lives. They determine our weather, our\nclimate, and much more. The ocean currents and wind systems transport heat from the equator\nto the poles and operate like a large engine\nfor the global climate. In the oceans, there are numerous\ncurrents. The so-called ocean conveyor belt\nis very important for our climate. This term describes a combination\nof currents that result in four of the five global\noceans exchanging water with each other. They form a worldwide circulation system. The conveyor belt is also called the\nthermohaline circulation, with “thermo” referring to\nthe temperature, and “haline” to the salt content\nof the water. Both determine the density of the water. While the masses of water may be\nmoved in part by wind, primarily the different densities\nof the global oceans are responsible for their movement. Warm water has a lower density and rises\nwhile cold water sinks. The water’s density also increases with\na higher salt content. At the equator the heat from the\nsun is especially strong, resulting in a lot of evaporation and\nthus a rise in the water’s salt content. That is where the Gulf Stream begins. The Gulf Stream is very important\nfor the European climate. Its length of 10,000 km makes it one of\nthe largest and fastest currents on Earth, and it’s very warm. At roughly 2 m/s it brings up to\n100,000,000 m³ of water per second towards Europe. A constantly blowing wind, the\nsoutheast trade wind, drives warm surface water to\nthe northwest, into the Gulf of Mexico, where it heats up\nto 30 °C. The turning of the Earth and the\nwest winds then direct the Gulf Stream towards Europe\nand split it up. One part flows south, another east\nto the Canary Current, and a third part flows north where\nit releases a lot of heat into the atmosphere as the\nNorth Atlantic Current. The water becomes colder there. Its salt content and density rise on\nthe account of evaporation and it drops down between\nGreenland, Norway, and Iceland. There we also find the largest\nwaterfall on Earth. The so-called Chimneys, roughly 15-km-wide\npillars with water falling up to 4,000 m. 17,000,000 m³ of water per second, or\nroughly 15 times more water than is carried by all the rivers in the world. This creates a strong maelstrom, which\nconstantly pulls in new water and is the reason that the Gulf Stream\nmoves towards Europe. Countless species use the Gulf Stream as a\nmeans of transport on their trips from the Caribbean to northern areas. But it doesn’t just bring us animals; an enormous quantity of warm air also\ncomes with it. In order to produce the same heat that it\nbrings to the shores of Europe, we would need 1,000,000 nuclear\npower plants. That’s why we also call the Gulf Stream\na heat pump. Without it, the temperature would\nbe significantly colder here, at least five to ten degrees. Instead of lush fields, we would have\nlong winters and sparse ice-covered landscapes in Europe. In the last few years, scientists and\npundits in the media have repeatedly expressed the fear that the Gulf Stream\ncould come to a standstill due to climate change. Because if the polar caps actually melt,\nthe salt content in the water off Greenland would fall, as would\nits density. The North Atlantic Current would no longer\nbe heavy enough, and so it woundn’t sink as usual. In the worst case, that would bring the\nGulf Stream, our heat pump, to a stop. Some climate experts also assume that\nclimate change could compensate for this effect. We know that it can be normal for the\nclimate to change by looking at the development of the Earth\nover the last few million years. There are ice ages and warm periods. In the last ice age, a gigantic flood of\nmelting water crippled the heat-bringing North Atlantic Current,\ncovering the northern hemisphere in ice. Scientists have different views on the\nimpact that climate change will have on the global ocean conveyor belt, but\none thing is clear: when the climate changes, then the complex\nsystem of ocean currents and winds, which has remained fairly stable since the\nlast ice age, will change in ways that we don’t\nyet understand.

    "content": "If you are like most people, there is a gap \nbetween the person you are and the person you   wish to be. There are little things you think you \nshould do and big things you ought to achieve. From working out regularly, eating healthily, \nlearning a language, working on your novel,   reading more or simply actually doing \nyour hobby instead of browsing reddit. But it sometimes seems that to achieve \nyour goals, you have to become a different   person. Someone who is consistent, puts in \nmore effort, has discipline and willpower.   Maybe you have tried your hardest to be like \nthat. And it worked! For a while. Until you   find yourself slipping back into your old \nways. In the end, you always seem to fail.   And with every failed attempt, you become more \nand more frustrated and annoyed with yourself. If you believe “success and hustle” \ninternet, it is all your own fault:   if you don't succeed, you just didn’t want it \nenough and the failure is all you. But change   is actually hard. And as with most things in \nlife, understanding why makes things easier. The Jungle Imagine your brain as a lush and \ndense jungle. Moving through it,   say to make a decision to do something, \nis like moving through an *actual* jungle:   It is hard and it costs energy. \nYour brain hates expending energy,   so it came up with a trick: All your actions and \nbehaviors leave paths in the jungle of your brain. As you start doing something, you trample down \nsome plants and make rough, improvised trails   through the undergrowth. The more often you do \nthe thing, the more pronounced the trail becomes.   Over time it turns into a path that is \neasier to tread, so you take it more often   and it turns into a street. As you repeat \ndoing the thing, over and over for years,   the street turns into a highway. Traversing it \nbecomes effortless, familiar and comfortable. The more pronounced your brain highways, \nthe more you get used to their comfort.   So we continue to use them, which means \nwe tend to do what we have always done.   This is why change is hard, especially as an adult   when your jungle is criss-crossed by \nlots of established streets and highways. To understand how those highways are built \nwe need to distinguish between two things:   Routines and habits. The Things You Do: Routines and Habits A routine is a sequence of actions that you carry \nout the same way every time because they’ve worked   out well for you. For example, you get the \nsame ingredients for your favorite dish and   cook them in a certain order, because you like \nthe taste of the result. Or before going to bed   you set an alarm at 6:30 because \nthis is when you want to get up. Imagine routines executed by a wise planner. It is \nslow and analytical, responsible for strategizing   and mental calculations. The planner is \naware of the future and carefully considers   what kind of result you want. Based on that, it \nchooses actions to achieve specific outcomes,   even if they are uncomfortable, like \ntaking a shower after getting up. Routines can eventually turn into \nhabits, which feel much easier   because they are basically a sequence of \nactions carried out without thinking about them.   You have done them so often before that \nyour brain considers them rewarding   and a great response to a situation. So a \nhabit can feel like you’re on autopilot.   You don’t have to convince yourself to do \nsomething that’s a habit - you just do it. The important thing about habits is \nthat they are set in motion by triggers,   context cues that can be single \nthings or entire situations,   that give your brain the signal \nto start the behavior or action. You already have a lot of triggers in \nyour life: like when you see your phone,   you almost always unlock the screen. Or you reach \nfor the seat belt when you sit in a car. Or when   you buy your coffee before work, you also get a \ncookie, even though you aren’t actually hungry. Habits are executed by an impulsive toddler. \nIt responds to your immediate desires, based   on what is around you. Without considering \nany longer-term goals. For the toddler,   the future doesn’t exist and it hates hard work. \nSo when it notices a trigger, it steers you to   take this easy road inside your brain that leads \nto a familiar rewarding result. If you get coffee,   the toddler also wants the cookie, just \nbecause that’s what you do every morning. ​This rewarding feeling is also how most of \nyour bad habits started: chocolate is tasty,   browsing reddit is occasionally \nmildly entertaining.   This is why you repeat these actions, \neven if they are bad for you.   Rewarding feelings associated with an action \ndemand to be repeated and so a bad habit is born. While the toddler sounds like \na built-in sabotage mechanism,   it is as important as the wise planner and \nactually they work together most of the time! You need your wise planner for thinking big \nthoughts and parallel parking and doing your   taxes. But letting your wise planner do everything \nwould cost too much energy. Outsourcing mundane   and repetitive tasks to habits, managed by \nthe toddler, allows your brain to easily   manage your daily life, while dealing with more \ncomplex mental challenges at the same time. So if we want to change and introduce \na new behavior into our lives,   we can actually use these energy \nsaving mechanisms to make it easier. We will focus on small things, not big ones.   Improving your life a little is \nso much better than aiming high   and changing nothing. Especially because small \nchanges can do a lot over months and years. How To Build a Habit If you want to make change easier, \nthe best way may not be to force   it with willpower but to convince your \nbrain that it’s not that big of a deal.   By creating new routines and then turning \nthem into habits. You want your wise planner   to construct that first trail and then use your \ntoddler to help initiate the action effortlessly. Let us say, you want to work out \nto be fitter, a very common goal.   The first thing to do is to break down this \npretty vague goal into clear, separate actions,   because the idea is to make the action \nitself as easy a threshold as possible:   so small it is manageable and so specific \nthat you don’t have to think about it a lot. For example, a tangible, \ncontrollable action might be   “doing ten squats” every morning. So you \ncan start by trying to create a routine   but already include clear triggers \nthat the toddler can pick up later on. Remember, a trigger is nothing more than a \nsignal that you always associate with the action.   They can be visual pointers like seeing \na particular object, like your training   outfit. Or a certain time of day, or a designated \nplace like a nearby park – or even better, all of   these things combined. The important thing is that \nyou always start doing your action in a specific   context. This trigger is the start button that \nwill eventually set off the action automatically. So to establish a home workout habit with ten \nsquats to begin with, you could make sure to   always do them with your exercise gear on, at the \nsame place and time, like in your living room at   8am. Once you have your trigger and action, \nall you need to do is repeat them regularly,   ideally every day. If you keep going, they \nwill change from a routine to a habit,   from a trail to a highway. Don’t get this wrong, \nthe squats will still take you energy to do – but   the decision to do them will feel much less like \na chore and more like a regular part of your day. While this is simple, it is not easy. Many things you want to turn into habits don’t \noffer as much instant gratification as wasting   time on reddit. To make your new action easier \nto repeat and more likely to be picked up by   the toddler, try to make it pleasurable. \nNot necessarily by rewarding yourself   after you did it, but by making the action \nor behavior itself more enjoyable. Like only   listening to your favorite podcast while \nworking out, or chipping away at your taxes   while you wait for civilization to load the next \nround. You need to figure out what works for you. In principle, that's it. Frustratingly simple, like most things you can \ndo to make your life better. How long it takes   for your toddler to take over and establish a \nhabit varies widely. It depends on the behavior   you are trying to get used to, what kind of person \nyou are, your stress levels and many more things.   It takes anything between 15 and 250 \ndays until a new habit is kicked off   automatically by its trigger. You won't \nknow how long it will take for you. Starting is the easy part, \nespecially in the first week or two.   Continuing to do it every day is the hard \npart. But it does get easier as you keep going. There are no silver bullets for \nchange. But the science of habits   is a reminder that it is possible, \nno matter how old or young you are.   Even if you only end up doing a little more good \nstuff or a few new things, that’s still a success.   Being a little bit more healthy or knowledgable \nis a million times better than being unhappy about   a thing and changing nothing. In the end, \nchange is a direction, not a destination. So now that we hopefully gave you a bit \nof insight and motivation, this is the   moment to sell you a thing! But please know, you \ndo not need to buy anything to work on yourself. Having said that, we struggle with \nchange as much as anyone else,   so we created our own habit journal, as much for \nourselves as for you. Before we printed anything,   we tested it on ourselves and got \nfeedback from the Kurzgesagt team. The idea is for you to track your habit \nprogress for your desired behavior.   There is a tutorial part which guides you through \nthe hardest part of the process step by step.   You’ll get helpful pointers, reflect on your \nprogress and how you could make things easier for   yourself. Once you get through the tutorial part \nthe habit journaling starts, regularly interwoven   by examples, science Breaks and reflections that \nwill hopefully keep the journey interesting. Like our Gratitude Journal it is cloth-bound, \nwith an embossed hardcover and printed on   high-quality paper. Nice to the touch and \nwith lots of beautiful illustrations this   book is compangion on your personal change \njourney, however small or big it may be. Getting things from our shop is \nthe best way to support Kurzgesagt   and what we try to do here on the \nchannel. Thank you for watching."

    "content": "humans rule Earth without competition but we're about to create something that may change that our last invention the most powerful tool weapon or maybe even entity artificial super intelligence this sounds like science fiction so let's start at the beginning intelligence is the ability to learn reason acquire Knowledge and Skills and use them to solve problems intelligence is power and we're the species that exploited it the most so much so that Humanity broke the game of Nature and took control but the journey there wasn't straightforward for most animals intelligence costs too much energy to be worth it still if we track intelligence in the tree of species over time we can see lots of diverse forms of intelligence emerge the earliest brains were in flatworms 500 million years ago just a tiny cluster of neurons to handle basic body functions it took hundreds of millions of years for species to diversify and become more complex life conquered New environments gained new senses and had to contend with Fierce competition over resources but in nature all that matters is survival and brains are expensive so for almost all animals a narrow intelligence fit for a narrow range of tasks was enough in some environments animals like birds octopuses and mammals evolved more complex neural structures for them it paid off to have more energy consuming skills like Advanced navigation and communication until 7 billion years ago the hominins emerged we don't know why but their brains grew faster than their relatives something was different about their intelligence very slowly it turned from narrow to General from a screwdriver to a multi-tool able to think about diverse Problems 2 million years ago homo erector saw the world differently from anyone before as something be understood and transformed they controlled fire invented tools and created the first culture we probably emerged from them around 250,000 years ago with an even larger and more complex brain it enabled us to work together in large groups and to communicate complex thoughts we used our intelligence to improve our lives to ask how things work and why things are the way they are with each Discovery we asked more questions and pushed forward Ward preserving what we learned outpacing what evolution could do with genes knowledge Builds on knowledge progress was slow at first and then sped up exponentially agriculture writing medicine astronomy or philosophy exploded into the world 200 years ago science took off and made us even better at learning about the world and speeding up progress 35 years ago the internet age began today we live in a world made to suit our needs created by us us for us this is incredibly new we forget how hard it was to get here how enormous the steps on the intelligence ladder were and how long it took to climb them but once we did we became the most powerful animal in the world in a heartbeat but we may be in the process of changing this we're building machines that could be better at the very thing that gave us the power to conquer the planet Humanity's final invention artificial intelligence artificial intelligence or AI is software that performs mental tasks with a computer code that uses silicon instead of neurons to solve problems in the beginning AI was very simple lines of code on paper mere proofs of concept to demonstrate how machines could perform mental tasks only in the 1960s did we start seeing the first examples of what we would recognize as AI a chatbot in 1964 approach program to sort through molecules in 1965 slow specialized systems requiring experts to use them their intelligence was extremely narrow built for a single task inside a controlled environment the equivalent of flat worms 500 million years ago doing the minimum amount of mental work progress in AI research paused several times when researchers lost hope in the technology but just like changing environments create new niches for Life the world around AI changed between 1950 and 2000 computers got a billion times faster while programming became easier and widespread in 1972 AI could navigate a room in 1989 it could read handwritten numbers but it remained a fancy tool no match for humans until in 1997 an AI shocked the World by beating the world champion in chess proving that we could build machines that could surpass us but we calmed ourselves because a chest spot is quite stupid not a flatworm but maybe a bee only able to perform a specialized narrow task but within this narrow task it's so good that no human will ever again beat AI a chess as computers continued to improve AI became a powerful tool for more and more tasks in 2004 it drove a robot on Mars in 2011 it began recommending YouTube videos to you but this was only possible because humans broke down problems into easyto digest chunks that computers could solve quickly until we taught AIS to teach themselves rise of the self-learning Machines this is not a technical video so we're massively oversimplifying here in a nutshell the sheer power of supercomputers was combined with the almost endless data collected in the information age to make a new generation of ai ai experts began drastically improving forms of AI software called neur neural networks enormously huge networks of artificial neurons that start out being bad at their tasks they then used machine learning which is an umbrella term for many different training techniques and environments that allows algorithms to write their own code and improve themselves the scary thing is that we don't exactly know how they do it and what happens inside them just that it works and that what comes out the other end is a new type of AI a capable black box of code the these new AIS could Master complex skills extremely quickly with much less human help they were still narrow intelligences but a huge step up in 2014 Facebook AI could identify faces with 97% accuracy in 2016 an AI beat the best humans in the incredibly complex game of Go in 2018 a self-learning AI learned chess in 4 hours just by playing against itself and then defeated the best specialized chess bot since then machine learning has been applied to reading image processing solving tests and much more many of these AIS are already better than humans for whatever narrow task they were trained but they still remained a simple tool AI still didn't seem that big of a deal for most people and then came the chatbot chat GPT the work that went into it is massive it trained on nearly everything written on the internet to learn how to handle language which it now does better than most people it can summarize translate and help with some math problems it's incredibly more broad than any other system just a few years ago not crushing any single Benchmark but order of them at once many large tech companies are spending billions to build powerful competitors AI is already transforming customer service banking Healthcare marketing copyrighting creative spaces and more AI generated content has already taken hold of social media YouTube and news websites elections are expected to be inundated by Propaganda and misinformation no one is sure how much good or harm can come from adopting AI everywhere change is scary there will be winners and losers one of the biggest questions governments and corporations have now is how to manage the transition to an AI boosted economy all these potential gains or risks are just the result of today's AI chat gpt's intelligence is a major step up but it remains narrow one it can write a great essay in seconds it doesn't understand what it's writing but what if the AIS stopped being narrow General AI what makes humans different from current AI is our general intelligence humans can technically absorb any piece of knowledge and start working on any problem we're great at many very different skills and tasks from playing chess to writing or solving science puzzles not equally of course some of us are experts in some fields and beginners in others but we can technically do all of them in the past AI was narrow and able to become good at one skill but was rather bad in all the others simply by building faster computers and pouring more money into AI training will get us new more powerful generations of AI but what is the next step for AI is to become a general intelligence like us an AGI if the AI improvement process continues as it has been it's not unlikely that AGI could be better in most or even all skills that humans can do we don't know how to build AGI how it will work or what it will be able to do since narrow AIS today are capable of mastering one mental task quickly HGI might be able to do the same with all mental tasks so even if it starts out stupid and HGI might be able to become as smart and capable as a human while this sounds like science sence fiction most AI researchers think this will happen sometime this Century maybe already in a few years humanity is not ready for what will happen next not socially not economically not morally earlier we defined intelligence as the ability to learn reason acquire Knowledge and Skills and use them to solve problems all things humans excel at an AGI as intelligent as even an average human would already disrupt modern civilization because they're not Bound by the same limitations as we are today's AIS like chat gbt already think and solve the tasks they were made for at least 10 times faster than even very skilled humans maybe AGI will be slower but it may also be faster maybe much faster and since HGI are software you could copy them endlessly as long as you have enough storage and run them in parallel there are 8 million scientists in the world now imagine an AI copied a million times and put to work imagine 1 million scientists working 24/7 thinking 10 times faster than humans without being distracted only focused on the task they've been given what if suddenly HGI could do all intelligence-based jobs in the world from interpreting law to coding to creating animated YouTube videos better faster and much cheaper than humans would whoever controls this AGI suddenly own the economy and thinking bigger human progress is our intelligence applied to problems so what could a million agis achieve solve fundamental questions of science like dark energy invent new technology that gives us Limitless energy fix climate change cure aging and cancer but then again sadly humans apply their intelligence not just for the benefit of all what if the agis are tasked to guide drones or pull the triggers in war or to engineer a virus that only kills people with green eyes or to create the most profitable social media so addictive that people starve in front of their screens the creation of AGI could reasonably be as big of an event as taming fire or electricity and give whoever invents it equally as much power but now let's go one step further what if the potential of AGI doesn't stop here intelligence explosion intelligence and knowledge build and accelerate each other but humans are limited by biology and evolution once we evolved the right Hardware our software outpaced evolution by orders of magnitudes and within a heartbeat we ruled this planet but our software basically hasn't changed much since then which is why we have obesity and destroy the climate for short-term gains since AGI is software on a computer once it's smart enough to do AI research the rate of AI progress should speed up a lot and that results in better AI That's better at AI research without much human involvement it may even be possible that AI could learn how to directly improve itself in which case some experts fear this feedback loop could be incredibly fast maybe just months or years after the first self-improving hii is switched on maybe it would actually take decades we simply don't know this is all speculative but such an intelligence explosion might lead to a true superintelligent entity we don't know what such a being would look like what its motives or goals would be what would go on in its inner world we could be as laughably stupid to superintelligence as squirrels are to us unable to even comprehend its way of thinking this hypothetical scenario keeps many people up at night humanity is the only example we have of an animal becoming smarter than all others and we have not been kind to what we perceive as less intelligent beings AGI might be the last invention of humanity it's possible that it could become the most intelligent and therefore most powerful being on earth a God in a box that could exercise its power to bring unimaginable wealth and happiness to humans while securing our future or it could subvert civilization and bring about our end with Humanity unable to come up with a way to stop it we'll look at some of these potential Futures in more videos but for now let's wrap up the only thing we know for sure is that today right now many of the largest and richest companies in the world are racing to create ever more powerful AIS whatever our future is we

    "content": "Every two years one million Japanese \ndisappear.  China’s population will halve by the end of the century, the median age in Italy has reached 48.  All around the world birth rates are crashing – Is humanity \ndying out? What is going on and how bad is it? For hundreds of thousands of years the human \npopulation barely grew at all, haunted by disease,   famine and war until the industrial revolution – \nexponential progress led to exponential growth,   pushing our numbers to 6 billion in the \nyear 1999 and 8 billion just 24 years later.   And our numbers will continue to rise \nfor at least another 60 years – but this growth obscures something: \nPeople kinda stopped having babies. For a stable population, every couple needs to \nhave two children on average. If the number is higher it grows, if lower, it shrinks. \nIf it's well below, it shrinks a lot, and quickly: Like in South Korea, one of the hottest \nexporters of pop culture. Its fertility rate lay at 0.8 children per woman \nin 2022, the lowest in the world. This means 100 South Koreans of childbearing \nage today will have 40 kids. Who then will have 16 kids, \nwho then will have 6.   If nothing changes then within 100 years \nthere will be 94% fewer young people  and South Korea will see a population implosion. \nThat is if things stay the same – we have yet to see if there is a \nbottom to fertility rates. Although looking at the bigger picture and absolute \nnumbers, this population will not shrink that much – it simply returns to the level it once was. \nIn 1950 there were 20 million South Koreans,   in 2023 there are 52 million. And by 2100 there \nwill be 24 million again. But the issue is not that there \nwill be fewer South Koreans,  the issue is the composition of the population. In 1950 the median age was 18. In 2023 it is 45. \nIn 2100 it will be 59. A country of seniors. And South Korea is far from alone. China may be seeing the steepest population \nreversal in history, unstoppable at this point. Rapid industrialization, urbanisation and \nrising incomes meant that the Chinese started to   prefer smaller families. That, plus the \nintroduction of the One Child Policy,   which aimed to slow population growth, means that \nChina has had a low fertility rate for decades. With a fertility rate of 1.16 births per woman,   within four generations 100 young \nChinese will turn into 20.   China's fertility rates are now one of the \nlowest in East Asia, lower than even Japan's. In comparison Europe’s depopulation \nis much slower despite low fertility,   since unlike Asia most states have had a steady \nflow of immigrants. The impact is complex,   as a good chunk of immigrants come \nfrom other low fertility rate areas,   the number of immigrant women who do have a lot of \nchildren is not yet high enough to make a big dent   and fertility rates of immigrants tend to adjust \nto the native population within 2-3 generations. In Eastern Europe, the decline has sped up even \nmore because many young people have emigrated to   stronger economies, like Germany – whose median \nage is one of the highest in the world at 46. Latin America fell below \nreplacement in 2015. In the US,   immigration is the only thing keeping \nthe population growing substantially. There are still places where fertility \nrates have not fallen below replacement yet:   In much of the Middle East, North and Sub \nSaharan Africa fertility is still high,   which creates the same concerns \nabout overpopulation as when   Asia grew very quickly in the 1950s, \nbut that turned out to be unfounded. But recently the UN has reduced its forecast \nfor Africa’s population drastically. For Nigeria   estimates were lowered from 733 million \nto 546 million by 2100. Similar trends are   being noted across the continent. As Africa \ndevelops, fertility rates are shrinking much   faster than anticipated. It is becoming \nmore likely that East Asia’s story will   repeat itself – by the end of the century most \nplaces in Africa may be below replacement too. So declining fertility rates \nand ageing populations have   become a general trend, all over the world. Why is all of this a big deal? Demographics & Poverty For a functioning society you need enough \npeople in the prime of their lives. Young and middle aged people do most of \nthe work. In any economic system,   working age people create a society’s wealth. In retirement you stop contributing as \nmuch to the economy. But the majority of   healthcare costs are generated by \nseniors. The way the world worked   in the past was that a lot of younger \npeople took care of a few older people. Imagine a society where most people are \nolder than 60. The financial burden for   the young will be immense, unsustainable \neven for the richest countries. Even in the best case this will mean \npeople having to work way longer,   exploding health care costs and poverty, while \nstates with shrinking income struggle to keep up   with rising costs. Technology might soften \nthe blow, but can’t compensate entirely. We can see this happening already – 11 out of \n31 provinces in China are running deficits for   their pension funds. They got old before \nthey got rich and now they can’t really   catch up anymore. China’s working age \npopulation is predicted to fall by 20%,   or 200 million people by 2050 – as much as \ntoday’s entire working age population of the US. Infrastructure collapse is an almost \nuniversal constant of population decline.  Because infrastructure works at scale and \ndoesn’t get cheaper to operate if it is used   by fewer people. If a population declines, \nbe it because of urbanisation or the loss   of industry and employment – once people and \ntheir income disappear, the resources necessary   to sustain infrastructure disappear too.\nYou can see it in many depopulated towns   and cities in East Germany that suffered \nsharp population decline after German   reunification. Or look at Japan. You can \ntour the countryside to see dying towns. Wait – if there are fewer people, won’t life get \ncheaper and better and there’ll be more resources   to go around? Well no – population decline \ndoesn't lead to prosperity. It’s people’s   ideas and work that create our prosperity, \nnot the mere availability of resources. Another danger for ageing societies is that \nelected governments could decide to mostly   represent the interests and fears of their \nelderly populations – potentially leading   to short term thinking and a preference \nfor conserving wealth over innovation.   That's not a society that can handle \nissues like climate change, which need   massive investment and fresh ideas – something \nthe world is already having a hard time with. Many people think that having fewer humans on earth is \nactually a good thing because our societies are   too unsustainable, we are using up too many \nresources and because of climate change. The problem is, that even if you want fewer\nhumans, this process is very likely too slow   to have a positive impact on the environment – the \nworld population is going to grow for at least 60   more years before it may shrink again – by then we \nhave to solve climate change. Likewise, any other   upsides a lower population might have will most \nlikely not materialise themselves this century. So Just Like \nImport People? The easiest solution seems to be immigration, \nbut the fertility of immigrants adjusts to local   levels within three generations. So you need \na constant influx of new migrants – which is   not sustainable long term as birth rates are \ndropping everywhere. The only way would be   to keep poor countries poor, so that the young \nand motivated migrate to developed countries,   looking for opportunity and a better life. \nKind of an immoral thing to wish for. By the end of the century Africa will have \nthe highest number of young people in the   world and so African migrants might become \nthe world's most sought after immigrants,   with elderly nations fighting hard for \nevery person willing to make the move. Immigration also can create societal or cultural \ntensions, which is a universal phenomenon in all   cultures – especially when cultures with very \ndifferent sets of values meet – often leading   to a backlash that slows immigration down \nagain. It’s easy to be frustrated at this,   but ignoring this will only divide societies, \nempower demagogues and increase xenophobia. Economically, immigration is \nlargely beneficial for societies,   even if this seems counterintuitive to many \npeople. Especially countries like the US,   an immigrant nation built on the idea of personal \nfreedom and opportunity through hard work,   will benefit the most. Countries like this \nwill have a clear advantage this century,   especially if they can attract the \nworld’s brightest and most ambitious. Conclusion & Our Opinion This topic is way too big, affects \nsocieties as diverse as literally   all of humanity. So please take this \npart with a gigantic grain of salt,   obviously we are looking at this from \nour central European perspective. One way to look at falling birthrates is \nas a side effect of the world being less   bad than it was. Especially women are\nfreer, more educated and wealthier than in the past.   But it turns out that if societies are better \noff, individuals often decide to have fewer kids.  Interestingly, there is a gap between how many \nkids people want and how many they are having: The mean number of kids women in Europe want is \naround 2.3, much more than they are actually having. While we gained a lot of freedoms in the last \ncentury, across continents and economic systems,   that came at a cost: The tight knit \ncommunities and family structures   that were part of our nature, where \nkids could be brought up by a village. Today young parents have to deal with \ndifferent challenges and societal expectations. Women are kind of ground down between the wish \nand expectation to have a family and a career,   being pressured to do both but not \ncompromise either. Men are sharing   parental duties more equally than they used to, \nbut are often still expected to be the provider. And it is sadly true that usually, at least one \nparent's career is held back. In many developed   countries the gender pay gap is chiefly a \npay gap between mothers and everyone else. But it is not just outside pressure: Our \nculture of individualism probably plays a   role too. We have only one life to explore, be \nfree, travel, have fun, accomplish something and try to be happy. So people commit \nto partners later in life and often   decide against big families or any at all. And \nthat’s fair, nobody owes their country babies. So far no country has successfully managed \nto increase birth rates significantly,   so as of now we don’t really know what works. But \nhere are a few options to at least make the lives   of parents much easier: free and abundant access \nto childcare, financial benefits for parents,   more and cheaper housing. Parenthood has to stop \nbeing a career obstacle. And our culture needs   to become more positive towards families. \nAnd that is something we can all work on.   The next time you sit next to a crying baby \n– don’t be a jerk about it. Kids are hard. In the end, humanity will not die out because we're having \nfewer babies. The age and composition of our   societies changes quickly and we need to deal with \nthat sooner rather than later. But in the end,   of all the incredibly hard challenges we faced \nbefore, why would this be the one we can’t solve?  Getting to the bottom of the population crash \nstarts with analyzing and interpreting massive   amounts of data. And if you’re looking \nfor a free way to start building your   data skills — which are more essential than \never these days — we recommend Brilliant.org. Brilliant’s latest course, “Predicting with \nProbability,” will teach you everything   you need to get started in data science. No \ncoding required. You’ll analyze vast datasets,   compare distributions and master fundamental \nconcepts that are key to some of the most   in-demand careers in today's world. Beyond data, Brilliant is the best way \nto master key concepts in everything   from math and science to computer science and \nprogramming. Just set your goal and Brilliant   designs the perfect path—and equips \nyou with the right tools to reach it. They have thousands of lessons to \nexplore. And each one is interactive,   like a one-on-one version of a Kurzgesagt video.

    "content": "Nuclear war would forever split \nhuman history. Into anything that   happened before and the post-war apocalypse. In the worst case, mass fires consume everything \nwithin tens of thousands of square kilometers,   killing hundreds of millions within \nhours. But the worst part comes   after that - nuclear war could trigger a \nnuclear winter that might kill billions,   maybe even completely collapsing our civilization. \nHow does it work and what would it look like? Fire Causes Winter When a nuclear weapon is detonated, a bubble of \ngas hotter than the sun is forced into existence,   so hot that everything within kilometers \nimmediately begins to burn. The terror bubble   expands rapidly, filling the sky over its target, \ncreating a devastating shockwave that causes most   of the immediate destruction. Basically you \nbreak a lot of stuff and set it on fire – and   in the worst case this turns into a firestorm that \nconsumes everything and everyone on the ground. Right after the explosion a gigantic mushroom \ncloud rises over the destruction like a demon   throning over its perverse work, but in \nthe following hours a far more deadly   cloud forms. The fire burning cities, \nforests or fields, heats up so much air   that it creates its own micro climate and \nwind system. Hot air and hot smoke rise,   pulling in fresh air from the surroundings, \nand fresh oxygen stoking the flames even more.   This creates an updraft and forms \na colossal pyrocumulonimbus cloud   that carries the soot and aerosols from \nthe flames high into the stratosphere. Under normal conditions, the soot rising \nfrom a big fire is quickly washed out by rain.  But a pyrocumulonimbus cloud can \nreach altitudes well above the height   where rain clouds form. Once above the tropopause,   there is simply no weather to remove soot from \nthe atmosphere, so it can stay aloft for years. If this happens to a single city, it’s a tragedy, \nbut a fairly local one. But in a full scale   nuclear war, warring nations following the cold \nlogic of mutually assured destruction, could use   hundreds or even thousands of nuclear weapons all \nat once, creating hundreds of fire storms, sending   up to 150 million tons of soot, a cube the size \nof a skyscraper, directly into the stratosphere. In the next few days and weeks the soot \nbegins to blanket the earth at high altitudes,   absorbing light high above the ground \nand preventing sunlight from reaching   the surface . This is not like science fiction \nwhere the sky turns dark and the sun disappears.   Winter is what happens when just a little less \nsunlight hits the ground – and now suddenly a   lot less sunlight gets through. Yesterday the \nworld was normal. Today nuclear winter begins. Winter Causes Hunger How bad nuclear winter would be is still an active \narea of research. It all hinges on one thing:   How much stuff will burn really hot? How many \nfirestorms would be caused by the heat of the   explosions? This depends on many factors, from \nthe materials a city is made of, to the time of   the year, if a forest is nearby and so on. So just \nkeep in mind we are working with some assumptions. Here is the good news: Nuclear winter is \nnot permanent, and definitely no new ice age.  The effects on the climate only last as \nlong as the soot remains in the atmosphere,   which is at most a decade or so until it \nclears out and temperatures normalize. The bad news is that this causes almost \nimmediate climate change within a few   weeks – it disrupts our climate system \nfaster than any living being can adapt to. In this new climate our seasons are suddenly \nall wrong. Winters are much longer, summers   shorter and colder – or gone altogether. This \nalso means less evaporation over the oceans,   which means less rain and maybe large scale \ndroughts. This is bad because our food eats the sun.  Without good summers and enough rain, \ngrowing seasons shrink or even collapse. The majority of humanity lives in \nan area called the midlatitudes,   a strip of land that has the ideal temperature \nfor our species – not just because it's not   too hot or cold, it’s also where the plants \nwe eat grow best. The vast majority of the food   we eat stems from a few highly efficient \ncrops, that are mostly produced in a few   very agriculturally productive regions, like \nthe US Great Plains or Ukraine. From these   bread and rice baskets of the world, they \nget traded and shipped around the world. In the worst case of a full scale nuclear \nwar the temperatures in the midlatitudes   will probably stay below freezing for \nseveral years. Nothing at all can grow   under these conditions and the world's \nbreadbaskets would suddenly turn empty.  If food production crashes, the world's food \nproducers would very likely ramp up prices or   even stop selling food to other countries – if \nthey're still able to farm their fields at all. It's easy to calculate how many people can be \nalive on earth – you take all the calories we   can produce and divide them by what the \naverage person needs to survive. If you   have more people than calories, then within a few \nweeks you don’t anymore. Humanity has only a few   weeks' supply of crops and food, not enough \nto survive this drastic drop in production. But the climate is not the only issue: modern \nindustrialized agriculture is a complex affair   that relies on functioning supply chains to \nprovide unthinkable amounts of industrially   produced fertilizer and chemicals to kill weeds \nand vermin. Massive numbers of specialized modern   machinery is plowing, sowing, harvesting \nand distributing. After a nuclear war,   especially if the countries that produce the \nfood were part of the nuclear exchange, there   may simply be no more fuel, fertilizer or machine \nparts, because there are no more oil refineries,   ports and other essential infrastructure left, \ndamaging global food production even more. Ok, so now that we set the stage, let’s look   at what science says about the \nactual wars that could happen. Actual Nuclear War Today there are two main conflicts that scientists \nthink about when making calculations of nuclear   winter: a nuclear war between India and \nPakistan and one between the US and Russia. The most likely smallish nuclear exchange would \nbe fought today between India and Pakistan,   with relatively low yield weapons. Even \nin a pretty mild nuclear war like this,   the immediate explosions would \nkill around 27 million people,   which is horrible enough. In just a few \nhours, more people would die than in all   of World War 1. The ensuing fires \nwould not cause a nuclear winter,  but a mild ‘nuclear autumn’. But \neven this would disrupt the climate,   and thereby global agriculture, enough to \nstarve up to 250 million people worldwide. Unfortunately India and Pakistan are in an \narms race and have been increasing the number   and power of warheads in their arsenal. The next \nstage of escalation would be war with hundreds of   nuclear weapons, the bombs and fires destroying \nmany major population centers and killing over   100 million people. A war on this scale would \ncause a nuclear winter that would damage global   agriculture enough to cut the available calories \nfor humanity in half. The number of people that starve to death \nwould be as high as 2 billion. One in four humans alive today. The worst-case scenario is a full scale global \nwar between NATO nations and Russia – or China,   which also continues to build its nuclear \narsenal. In a war between a former,   future and current superpower, thousands \nof nuclear weapons could be detonated. In a scenario with around 4400 nuclear weapons, \n360 million people would perish right away. We   have no other event to even compare the death \nand destruction to. It's like humanity dropping   an asteroid on itself. The nuclear winter \nthat follows such an apocalyptic war would   tank human calorie production by as much \nas 90%. Not only would almost all of our   agriculture take an immediate and deadly \nhit, the climate would take at least a   decade to recover. Because a war like this would \nspecifically hit the world regions that produce   most of the food for humanity – recovery will \nbe much, much harder than with other conflicts. Within two years the global death toll from \nstarvation could rise to about 5 billion.   In mid latitude countries like Russia, China, \nCanada, the U.S. and much of Europe only a few   percent of the population might survive. \nHumanity will never be the same again. While nowhere is truly safe, some nations in \nthe southern hemisphere may fare well enough   to endure, while the rest of the world collapses. \nAll the nuclear weapon states are in the northern   hemisphere. So a few countries like Australia, New \nZealand, and Argentina may be able to endure for   a bunch of different reasons. Their nuclear winter \nwould be milder, they have a lot of livestock that   would not be as affected as crops. So they would \nprobably stop exporting food and focus on keeping   their own people alive – assuming they aren’t \ninvaded for their food by other starving nations. It's safe to say that the world would become \nextremely unpleasant for a long time and it's  impossible to know how many people will have \ndied when the nuclear winter ends. In the worst   case human civilization could collapse \nand the survivors would be thrown back   thousands of years, slowly trying to recover \na world full of scars and graves. Eventually,   when they've rebuilt civilization, would \nthey ever build nuclear weapons again? We know for sure that we need to do \nanything we can to make sure nuclear   war never happens.

    "content": "Have you ever been in an argument\nabout nuclear power? We have, and we found it\nfrustrating and confusing, so let’s try and get to grips\nwith this topic. [Intro] It all started in the 1940s. After the shock and horror of the war\nand the use of the atomic bomb, nuclear energy promised to be a peaceful\nspin-off of the new technology, helping the world get back on its feet. Everyone’s imagination was running wild. Would electricity become free? Could nuclear power help\nsettle the Antarctic? Would there be nuclear-powered cars,\nplanes, or houses? It seemed that this was just a few\nyears of hard work away. One thing was certain: the future\nwas atomic. Just a few years later, there was a sort\nof atomic age hangover; as it turned out, nuclear power was very\ncomplicated and very expensive. Turning physics into engineering\nwas easy on paper, but hard in real life. Also, private companies thought that\nnuclear power was much too risky as an investment; most of them would much\nrather stick with gas, coal, and oil. But there were many people who\ndidn’t just want to abandon the promise of the atomic age;\nan exciting new technology, the prospect of enormously\ncheap electricity, the prospect of being independent\nof oil and gas imports, and, in some cases, a secret desire to\npossess atomic weapons provided a strong motivation\nto keep going. Nuclear power’s finest hour finally came\nin the early 1970s, when war in the Middle East caused oil prices\nto skyrocket worldwide. Now, commercial interest and investment\npicked up at a dazzling pace. More than half of all the nuclear reactors\nin the world were built between 1970 and 1985. But which type of reactor to build,\ngiven how many different types there were to choose from? A surprising underdog candidate\nwon the day: the light water reactor. It wasn’t very innovative, and it wasn’t\ntoo popular with scientists, but it had some decisive advantages: it was there, it worked, and it wasn’t\nterribly expensive. So, what does a light water reactor do? Well, the basic principle is shockingly\nsimple: it heats up water using an artificial\nchain reaction. Nuclear fission releases several million\ntimes more energy than any chemical reaction could. Really heavy elements on the brink of\nstability, like uranium-235, get bombarded with neutrons. The neutron is absorbed, but the result\nis unstable. Most of the time, it immediately splits\ninto fast-moving lighter elements, some additional free neutrons, and\nenergy in the form of radiation. The radiation heats the surrounding water, while the neutrons repeat the process with other atoms, releasing more neutrons and radiation in a closely controlled chain reaction. Very different from the fast, destructive runaway reaction in an atomic bomb. In our light water reactor, a moderator\nis needed to control the neutrons’ energy. Simple, ordinary water does the job, which\nis very practical, since water’s used to drive the turbines anyway. The light water reactor became prevalent\nbecause it’s simple and cheap. However, it’s neither the safest, most\nefficient, nor technically elegant nuclear reactor. The renewed nuclear hype lasted barely\na decade, though; in 1979, the Three Mile Island nuclear\nplant in Pennsylvania barely escaped a catastrophe when\nits core melted. In 1986, the Chernobyl catastrophe\ndirectly threatened Central Europe with a radioactive cloud, and in 2011\nthe drawn-out Fukushima disaster sparked new discussions and concerns. While in the 1980s 218 new nuclear power\nreactors went live, their number and nuclear’s global share of\nelectricity production has stagnated since the end of the ’80s. So what’s the situation today? Today, nuclear energy meets around 10% of\nthe world’s energy demand. There are about 439 nuclear reactors\nin 31 countries. About 70 new reactors are under\nconstruction in 2015, most of them in countries\nwhich are growing quickly. All in all, 116 new reactors are\nplanned worldwide. Most nuclear reactors were built more than\n25 years ago with pretty old technology. More than 80% are various types of\nlight water reactor. Today, many countries are faced with\na choice: the expensive replacement of the aging reactors, possibly with more\nefficient, but less tested models, or a move away from nuclear power towards\nnewer or older technology with different cost and environmental\nimpacts. So, should we use nuclear energy? The pro and contra arguments will be\npresented here next week. Subscribe, and then you won’t miss it!"

    "content": "The fundamental currency of our universe is energy. It lights our homes, grows our food,\npowers our computers. We can get it lots of ways: Burning fossil fuels, splitting atoms, or sunlight striking photovoltaics. But there's a downside to everything Fossil fuels are extremely toxic, Nuclear waste is... well, nuclear waste, And, there are not enough batteries to store sunlight for cloudy days yet. And yet the sun seems to have virtually limitless free energy. Is there a way we could build a sun on Earth? Can we bottle a star? [Intro Jingle] The sun shines because of nuclear fusion. In a nutshell, fusion is a thermonuclear process. Meaning that the ingredients have to be incredibly hot. So hot, that the atoms are stripped of their electrons Making a plasma where nuclei and electrons bounce around freely. Since nuclei are all positively charged, They repel each other. In order to overcome this repulsion, The particles have to be going very, very fast In this context, very fast means \"very hot\" Millions of degrees Stars cheat to reach these temperatures. They are so massive, that the pressure in their cores Generates the heat to squeeze the nuclei together Until they merge and fuse Creating heavier nuclei and releasing energy in the process. It is this energy release that scientists hope to harness In a new generation of power plant, The fusion reactor. On earth it's not feasible to use this brute force method to create fusion. So if we wanted to build a reactor that generates energy from fusion, We have to get clever. To date, scientists have invented two ways of making plasmas hot enough to fuse: The first type of reactor uses a magnetic field to Squeeze a plasma in a doughnut shaped chamber Where the reactions take place. These magnetic confinement reactors Such as the I.T.E.R. reactor in France, Use superconducting electromagnets cooled with liquid helium To within a few degrees of absolute zero. Meaning that they host some of the biggest temperature gradients in the known universe. The second type called \"Inertial confinement\" Uses pulses from super-powered lasers To heat the surface of a pellet of fuel Imploding it, briefly making the fuel hot and dense enough to fuse. In fact, one of the of the most powerful lasers in the world Is used for fusion experiments At the National Ignition Facility in the U.S. These experiments and others like them around the world are today, just experiments. Scientists are still developing the technology, And although they can achieve fusion, Right now, it costs more energy to do the experiment Then they produce in fusion. The technology has a long way to go before it's commercially viable, and maybe it never will be. It might just be impossible to make a viable fusion reactor on earth, But if it gets there, it will be so efficient That a single glass of sea water, could be used to produce as much energy as burning a barrel of oil, with no waste to speak of. This is because fusion reactors\nwould use hydrogen or helium as fuel And sea water is loaded with hydrogen But not just any hydrogen will do. Specific isotopes with extra neutrons called Deuterium and Tritium Are needed to make the right reactions. Deuterium is stable and can be found in abundance in sea water, Though Tritium is a bit trickier. It's radioactive And there may only be 20 kilograms of it in the world Mostly in nuclear warheads Which makes it incredibly expensive. So we made need another fusion buddy for Deuterium instead of Tritium. Helium-3, an isotope of Helium,\nmight be a great substitute. Unfortunately, it's also incredibly rare on earth. But here, the moon might have the answer. Over billions of years, the solar wind may have built up huge deposits Of Helium-3 on the moon. Instead of making Helium-3, we can mine it. If we could sift the lunar dust for helium, We'd have enough fuel to power the entire world for thousands of years. One more argument for establishing a moon base, if you weren't convinced already. Ok, maybe you think building a mini sun Still sound kind of dangerous But they'd actually be much safer\nthan most other types of powerplants A fusion reactor is not like a nuclear plant, Which can melt down catastrophically. If the confinement failed, then the plasma would expand and cool, And the reaction would stop. Put simply, it's not a bomb. The release of radioactive fuel, like Tritium, Could pose a threat to the environment. Tritium could bond with oxygen making radioactive water, Which could be dangerous as it seeps into the environment. Fortunately, there's no more than a few grams in use at a given time, So a leak would be quickly diluted. So we've just told you that theres nearly unlimited energy to be had At no expense to the environment In something as simple as water. So, whats the catch? Cost. We simply don't know if fusion power will ever be commercially viable. Even if they work, they might be too expensive to ever build. The main drawback, is that it's unproven technology Its a 10 billion dollar gamble And that money might be better\nspent on other clean energy That's already proven itself. Maybe we should cut out losses Or maybe, when the payoff is unlimited\nclean energy for everyone, It might be worth the risk.

    "content": "Human history is told by the energy we use. At first we had to use our muscles, then we learned to control fire. We industrialized the world using coal and oil and entered the Atomic Age when we learned how to split a nucleus. At each step, we increased our energy harvest to a scale never seen before and advanced as a species. Currently, we're slowly transitioning to renewables and if we're lucky, fusion energy will become viable in the future. As humanity progresses further, if we don't destroy ourselves or our habitat, we will likely gain complete control of our planet's resources. At that stage we'll probably begin to look outwards for new places to expand into. But space is hard and establishing a serious human presence in the solar system will require ungodly amounts of energy. Luckily, we know where to find it. The Sun - the ultimate source of energy. A furnace 100 quintillion times more powerful than our most efficient nuclear reactor. It shines with the energy of a trillion nuclear bombs per second. So, how do we get this energy? Not some of it, all of it. If we want to collect the most energy physically possible, we'll have to build the largest most ambitious structure in the universe. The Dyson Sphere, a megastructure that encompasses a whole star to capture its power output. For an intelligent species, building a Dyson Sphere is a technological leap on a par with the discovery of fire for our ancestors. The transition from a planetary species to an interstellar species. It would usher in an age of exploration and expansion on a scale we can barely imagine. So, what would it look like? Solid shell enveloping the Sun is probably not the way to go a large rigid body like that would be vulnerable to impacts possibly shattering it would be liable to drift and could crash straight into the Sun a More, viable design for a Dyson Sphere might be a Dyson swarm an enormous set of orbiting panels that collect the sun's power and beam it elsewhere such as sward would give humanity basically unlimited energy but building it won't be easy the Sun is very big so we need a lot of satellites if Each satellite is a square kilometer we'd need around 30 quadrillion to surround the Sun even if they're built as lightly as possible we need about 100 quintillion tons of material and Then we need the energy to actually put the parts together and deliver them to their positions around the Sun on top of all that we need to have a permanent infrastructure set up in space to start building let's assume for the purposes of this video that our descendants will take care of that and want to create the mega structure We can sort the challenges into three main categories materials design and energy To get the vast amounts of raw materials required for our Dyson swarm will have to largely disassemble a whole planet Of the planets available mercury is the best candidate it's the closest to the Sun and very metal-rich close to the Sun also Means less moving stuff around and mercury has no atmosphere and only about a third of the surface gravity of Earth making it comparatively easy to launch material into space Next we should consider the design of our swarm simpler is better Conventional solar panels are far too intricate and short lives our satellites need to operate without repairs or intervention for astronomically long times and they need to be cheap to produce But they're most likely going to be enormous mirrors which refocus sunlight to central collecting stations like in concentrated solar power on earth to build and launch them efficiently they must be incredibly light made of little more than polished metal full bound to some supports and Last we need the energy to build and launch the swarm itself taking a part of planets and launching things into space requires an enormous amount of energy for example if we used all the fossil fuels and Uranium on earth and we? Were perfectly efficient we could only launch as much Mass as Mount Everest into space a rather meager accomplishment compared to planetary disassembly To get the energy needed to build a Dyson Sphere it's almost as if you're going to need the power output of a dyson sphere But that's. Ok there's plenty of sunlight to be had on Mercury so let's get to work Humans are expensive to keep alive and are very sensitive to the environment So, we'd want to automate as much as possible Ideally we'd have a small crew of controllers who oversee an army of autonomous machines doing the actual work There are four major pieces of technology required solar collectors miners refiners and launch equipment the solar collectors are going to give us the energy we need to disassemble the planet To start maybe we deploy something like one square kilometer of them either as mirrors or as traditional solar panels they'll provide the energy to run our miners which strip-mine the surface of the planet and our refiners which extract valuable elements and fabricate them into our swarm satellites to get them into space we need a creative and efficient solution Rockets aren't too expensive and difficult to deorbit and reuse Instead, we'll want to use a sort of railgun a longer Electromagnetic track which launches our satellites at high speeds Our swarm satellites will be packed tight for launch unfurling like an enormous origami once in orbit from this point we can take advantage of exponential growth using the energy of the existing parts of the swarm to build more infrastructure on Mercury and launch new panels faster and faster each panel provides the energy to build another those to work together to build the next to Four become eight eight become 16 and so on within just about 60 doubling times the Sun would be completely surrounded by solar panels and This can happen quickly if a square kilometer of solar collectors takes a month to build we could be done in a decade if only our infrastructure on the planet's surface can keep up with the quickly growing budget of energy Even collecting 1% of the sun's energy is an unbelievable change in our species energy budget We could create the infrastructure to being basically unlimited amounts of energy around the solar system for all sorts of projects colonies on other worlds terraforming planets constructing more mega structures or even traveling to other stars it could be the start of an interstellar Civilization based on physics alone this is not just possible but easy It's such a simple process and such a necessary step for any species to expand beyond their home planet that many astronomers Think there are probably Dyson spheres already out there in the Milky Way we haven't spotted any yet but they could be there it's far from certain that humanity will ever get to this point our attention is too often focused on short-term political gains and Conflicts that will not matter in the long run but if we survive the challenges we've set ourselves we could potentially become the first species in the universe to create a structure with the scope of a star if We? Do it the only limitation left will be our own imagination"

    "content": "nuclear energy creates an uneasy feeling of danger for many people ancient and dangerous minerals are concentrated to awaken seemingly unnatural Powers creating horribly toxic elements that if they escape can and have killed people in horrible ways how many people has nuclear energy killed and [Music] how nuclear energy has been a thing since 19 51 and since then there have been around 30 reported accidents globally most of them were pretty minor compared to the two disasters everybody is familiar with Fukushima and Chernobyl Chernobyl is undoubtedly the worst nuclear accident in history for a number of reasons the reactor technology was old and Ill prepared for emergencies and the government response was slow and more concerned about image than damage control still only 31 people died directly in the accident but what makes nuclear energy scary is not reactors blowing up but the radiation they release so the real question is how many deaths through cancer and other diseases will chernobil cause here things get really complicated because you dip right into controversy and just discussing the different estimates and how they were calculated deserves a video of its own the most pessimistic estimate comes from a study commissioned by the European green party and projects up to 60,000 premature deaths by the year 2065 most scientific studies come up with numbers much lower than this the wh has estimated that in total the long-term death toll will be around 4,000 while the UN scientific committee on the effects of atomic radiation concluded that even this figure could be too high for more details on this check our research document the second big nuclear accident was Fukushima daichi in 2011 Fukushima did not only operate with much better technology that was less dangerous in the first place much better security measures were in place and the official response was fast and decisive and so the current death toll is only 573 the major difference here is that these deaths were not a consequence of radiation they were indirect deaths from the stress of the evacuation of the areas around the reactors and occurred almost entirely in older populations estimates of the possible long-term deaths from radiation vary WI from none at all to about 1,000 in terms of the other long-term consequences an increase in thyroid cancer in children has been observed but according to the who this is related to The increased screening rate by 2018 there had been only one confirmed death among workers as a result of radiation induced lung cancer now let's compare this to renewable energy solar wind and geothermal energy basically only cause deaths as a result of construction and maintenance accidents unfortunately their current share of global energy is pretty low the major player in renewable energy is hydrop power which mostly means building dams and letting water flow through turbines from a higher elevation to a lower elevation in total Hydro has been the most fatal in terms of accidents with hundreds of thousands of deaths in the last half century one accident clearly stands out the 1975 Banga hydroelectric Dam failure in China which has striking similarities to chobble Old technology poor design and poor management by authoritarian governments concerned about appearances in a nutshell a massive typhoon triggered intense flooding the destroyed the dam and subsequently a number of smaller dams in a chain reaction unleashing a flood of over 15 billion cubic M of water in total kilometer wide waves as high as buildings devastated thousands of square km of Countryside and countless communities all in all the death toll from just this one accident and its direct consequences is estimated to lie between 85,000 to 240,000 but all of these deaths caused by nuclear and renewable energy are actually negligible in comparison to the real killer energy source fossil fuel the most widely used source of energy and electricity when we burn fossil fuels to heat up water and make turbines spin or to cause mini explosions to move cars with internal combustion engines gases like ozone sulfur dioxide carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide are released into the atmosphere breathing in these gases disrupts lung function which aggravates chronic conditions like asthma and bronchitis and causes a wide range of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases but even more dangerous is the fine particle pollution burning fossil fuels causes a mixture of solid and liquid droplets of poisonous substances as small as 2.5 microns in diameter they easily find their way deep into your lungs and increase the risk of deadly diseases like lung cancer stroke and heart disease fossil fuel related air pollution is the number one cause of environmental related deaths in the world according to the who it accounts for 29% of all cases of lung cancer 177% of deaths from acute lower respiratory infection 24% from stroke 25% from ES schic heart disease and 43% from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease all in all outside air pollution adds up to the deaths of 4 million people each year what makes air pollution especially problematic and Sinister is the fact that the damage it causes happens very gradually which makes it hard for our brains that didn't evolve with subtle dangers in mind to realize the scope of the problem collectively air pollution from fossil fuels is estimated to have have killed around 100 million people in the past 50 years but wait is that really fair fossil fuels also provide over 80% of global energy so it makes sense that they cause the most deaths so let's compare deaths per energy unit deaths per energy unit produced a few Studies have compared the death rates from different energy sources per 1 tatt hour that's about the annual energy consumption of 2017 ,000 EU citizens or 12,600 US citizens to produce that much energy for one year coal causes 25 deaths oil causes 18 and natural gas three renewable energy causes one death every few decades and nuclear in the worst case nuclear energy would cause one death every 14 years one study even found that nuclear energy actually saved 2 million lives between 1971 and 2009 but by displacing fossil fuels from the global Energy Mix the numbers are clear even when using wildly pessimistic numbers nuclear energy is among the safest forms of energy generation and at a time when we're struggling to slow down rapid climate change it's a really valuable low carbon option however all these facts still leave one major argument that is fielded against nuclear power opponents of nuclear energy argue that nuclear waste and its lack of long-term storage solutions is an unacceptable problem and risk while proponents of nuclear energy say that until renewable energies are able to cover the complete energy demands of mankind it's arguably safer to store nuclear waste for the time being than to inhale poisonous gases and promote rapid climate change but a detailed discussion about nuclear waste would go too far here more about it in our sources let us know if you'd like a whole video about it so looking at the comparative death rates it's a bit concerning that some countries are replacing nuclear energy with fossil fuels mostly coal especially Germany and Japan have been the most active in dismantling their nuclear Fleet in aoy to appease the public the German government shut down 11 of its 17 nuclear facilities and plans to close the remaining reactors in 2022 the immediate Gap in energy production was filled by temporarily increasing coal production the energy source with the largest Health impacts and the worst con quences for climate change a 2019 analysis concluded that as a consequence the nuclear phase out has led to 1,100 avoidable deaths per year in Germany due to the increased air pollution in the years after 2010 so in conclusion nuclear energy feels way more dangerous than it actually is no matter how you look at it the one thing we should strive to get rid of as quickly as possible of fossil fuels to prevent the deaths they cause each year and to slow down climate CL change regardless of how much you personally care about climate change issues or which energy source you favor saving millions of lives should be something we can all agree on"

    "content": "At this very second, you are on\na narrow ledge between life and death. You probably don't feel it, but there's\nan incredible amount of activity going on inside you, and this activity can never stop. Picture yourself as a Slinky falling down \nan escalator moving upwards. The falling part represents the self-replicating processes of your cells. The escalator represents the laws of physics driving you forwards. To be alive is to be in motion but never arriving anywhere. If you reach the top of the escalator, there's no more falling possible, and you are dead forever. Somewhat unsettlingly, the universe wants you to reach the top. How do you avoid that? And why are you alive? [Amazing-sounding Kurz Intro Music] All life is based on the cell. A cell is a piece of the dead universe that separated itself from the rest so it could do its own thing for a while. When this separation breaks down, it dies and joins the rest of the dead universe again. Unfortunately, the universe would like for life to be done with doing its own thing. For some reason, it's not a fan of exciting things, but tries to be as boring as possible. We call this principle \"entropy,\" and it's a fundamental rule of our universe. It's pretty complicated and counterintuitive, so we'll explain it in detail in another video. For now, all you need to know is living things are inherently exciting. A cell is filled up with millions of proteins and millions more simpler molecules like water. Thousands of complex, self-replicating processes are happening up to hundreds of thousands of times every second. To stay alive and exciting, it has to constantly work to keep itself from achieving entropy and becoming boring and dead. The cell has to maintain a separation from the rest of the universe. It's doing this, for example, by keeping the concentration of certain molecules different on the inside and the outside by actively pumping out excess molecules. To do stuff like this, a cell needs energy. Energy is the ability of things in the universe to do work; to move or manipulate a thing; to create change. This ability cannot be created or destroyed. The set amount of energy in the universe will never change. We don't know why, it just is that way. So, billions of years ago, one of the most crucial challenges for the first living beings was to get usable energy. We don't know a lot about the first cells, except that they got their energy from simple chemical reactions. And they found the ultimate energy transfer system: the energetic building block of life. The molecule Adenosine Triphosphate, or ATP. Its structure makes it uniquely good at accepting and releasing energy. When a cell needs energy, for example, to pump out molecules or to repair a broken micro machine, it can break down ATP, and use the chemical energy to do work and create change. This is why living beings are able to do stuff. We don't know when or how exactly the first ATP molecule was made on earth. But every living thing we know uses ATP, or something very similar, to keep its internal machinery running. It's crucial for almost every process. Plants, fungi, bacteria, and animals need to survive. Without ATP, no life on Earth. Possibly anywhere. While breaking down chemicals for energy is nice and all, early life did miss out on the greatest available source of energy: The Sun. The Sun merges atoms and radiates photons away that carry energy into the solar system. But this energy is raw and indigestible. It needs to be refined. After hundreds of millions of years of evolution, finally, a cell figured out how to eat the Sun. It absorbed radiation and converted much of it into neat little chemical packages that it could use to stay alive. We call this process: Photosynthesis. You take photons that are wobbly with electromagnetic energy, and use a part of this energy to merge and combine different molecules together. The electromagnetic energy is converted into chemical energy stored in the ATP molecule. This process became even better, as some cells learned to create better chemical packages: Glucose, or sugar. Easy to break down, high in energy, and pretty tasty. This is so convenient, that some cells decided that instead of doing all that pesky photosynthesis work themselves, they would just swallow other cells that did, and take their glucose and ATP. This is widely considered one of the biggest anime betrayals in evolutionary history. And so things went on. Photosynthesizing cells could mostly harness energy at their surfaces, which limited their maximum energy production, which limited their evolutionary avenues somewhat. So, time passed. Some cells made sugar, others ate them. Evolution did its thing, but overall things stayed pretty much the same for hundreds of millions of years. Until, one day, a cell ate another, and did not kill it. Instead, they became one cell. Nothing had changed that day, but Earth would be different forever. This cell became the ancestor of all animals on this planet. Blue whales, amoeba. Dinosaurs, jellyfish. Pink fairy armadillos, and Sunda colugos. And of course, you. All can trace back their existence to this moment. The merging of two living beings is so important, because when those two cells became one, they became way more powerful. The formerly independent cell in the inside, could stop trying to survive. It could concentrate on one thing: make ATP. It became the powerhouse of the cell: the first mitochondria. The host cell's job became to ensure survival in the dangerous world, and provide the mitochondria with food. Mitochondria basically reverse photosynthesis, in a similarly complex process. They take sugar molecules that we got from eating other living things, combust them with oxygen and precursor molecules, to make new, energy-rich ATP molecules. This process works like a tiny furnace and spits out waste products like CO2, water, and a little bit of kinetic energy that you experience as body heat. This first division of labor, meant the new cell had way more energy available than any cell before, which meant more possibilities for evolution to enable more complex cells. At some point, these cells began to form small groups or communities, which lead to multicellular life, and finally, to you. Today, you are a pile of trillions of cells, each filled with dozens, if not hundreds of little machines that provides you with usable energy to stay alive. If this process is interrupted, even for a few minutes, you die. (Teaser of Kurzgesagt: Science War, coming in 2021.) But if life is so fragile, wouldn't it be a good idea to store ATP, like we store sugar in our fat cells, so we don't die if we stop breathing for a while? If life has solved so many problems to make you live today, what's up with the dying quickly thing? Even simple bacteria like E. Coli make about 50 times their body weight in ATP for every cell division. Your trillions of cells need a lot of ATP to keep you around. Every day, your body produces and converts about 90 million, billion, billion molecules of ATP: about your own body weight. You need a whole person's worth of ATP just to make it through a single day. Even storing enough ATP to last you a few minutes is basically impossible. An ATP molecule is really good for shifting energy around quickly, but it's terrible for storage, since it has only one percent of a glucose molecule's energy at three times its mass. So ATP is constantly produced and used up fairly quickly. This was the short and simplified story of the molecule that allows you to be different from the dead universe, and to be the slinky on the escalator. It is a weird story. There is this molecule you need to survive at all times. You need it to keep moving, because even a short break brings your slinky to a stop. And you need to make it yourself. It's like driving a car at full speed while producing fuel in the trunk with junk that you pick up from the side of the road. As far as we know, this all began billions of years ago, when tiny parts of the dead universe came together and became something else for a moment. It could keep itself going. It could grow. That moment set the slinky in motion, and it's been going ever since. From the very first cells, to you watching this now. At some point, you will merge with the rest of the dead universe again. Maybe you'll tell it stories about your adventures. Maybe not. But before you find out, you get to do what life does best. Making a dead universe, much more interesting.

    "content": "What would happen if you were to bring \na tiny piece of the Sun to Earth? Short answer: you die.\nLong answer: it depends which piece of the Sun. Like most of the matter in the universe, \nour Sun is neither solid, liquid or gas, but plasma. Plasma is when stuff is so hot that the nuclei and electrons can separate and flow around freely,\nwhich creates a goo like substance. So, you can imagine our Sun as an extremely big, spherical ocean of very hot goo. The deeper you, go the denser and weirder the goo becomes. So let's bring 3 samples (each the size of a house), \nto our lab here on Earth and see what happens. First sample: \nthe chromosphere. The chromosphere is the atmosphere of the Sun, \na layer of sparse gas up to 5,000 kilometers deep, that's covered in a forest of plasma spikes that can be almost as big as Earth. It's pretty hot here between 6,000 and 20,000 degrees Celsius, but if we brought a solvent of it to Earth, we're not really getting our money's worth. Where we take our sample, the chromosphere is over a million times less dense than air. So, compared to our atmosphere at sea level,\nit's basically the same as bringing the vacuum of space down to Earth. The moment our sample arrives, it would immediately be crushed by Earth's atmospheric pressure and implode. Air would rush to fill the vacuum and use as much energy as 12 kilograms of TNT in the process. This creates a high pressure shockwave, which shatters glass, ruptures ear drums, and maybe some internal organs. If you're standing too close it could kill you, so you'd better keep your distance Let's go deeper. Second sample, the photosphere Beneath the chromosphere, is the glowing surface of the Sun: the photosphere, which produces the light we see. It's covered in a grid of a million hot spots called granules. Each of them about as big as the United States, and over 5,000 degrees Celsius. These granules are the tops of convective columns, churning gas that brings the heat up from the center of the Sun to its surface. In these columns, a few hundred kilometres down, we take our second plasma sample. It has about the same pressure as our atmosphere on earth Though still much less dense for there. Its heat supports it, so it won't implode. Our sphere now carries twice as much energy, as much as 25 kilograms of TNT, that this time as heat. For a dazzling instant, this plasma would glow with a million times the brightness of the Sun seen from Earth, instantly lighting fires throughout our lab, but a few milliseconds later. Those fires are all that's left. The plasma has cooled to harmless gas, floating up from the flaming ruins. What if we go deeper? Third sample. The radiative zone. Here, the plasma is about two million degrees Celsius, and so dense and tightly packed, that it creates a sort of maze for itself. Energy in the form of photons tries to escape, but has to wander for hundreds of thousands of years, bouncing endlessly from particle to particle, until it eventually finds an exit. Bringing matter from here to our lab, is what experts call, a very bad idea. As soon as it arrives in our lab, the extreme pressure that holds the plasma tightly together is gone, and the material explodes with the power of a thermonuclear weapon. Our lab as well as the city around it will be destroyed in an instant. On the bright side, there won't be any radioactive fallout. With our lab destroyed, we can abandon the illusion that we're trying to do any science today. What if we go much, much deeper? Last sample. The core Here in the central 1% of the star, we find a third of the sun's mass. The matter here is compressed by the weight of the entire star above it. In the center of the core, the temperature is 15 million degrees, hot enough to make helium by smashing together hydrogen, powering the Sun by nuclear fusion. In billions of years after the death of the Sun, this core will remain as a white dwarf. If we brought a sample of it to Earth, it would cause a lot of inconvenience The biggest nuclear weapon ever detonated, had an energy of 40 megatons of TNT, or a cube the size of the Empire State Building. Our sample has the equivalent of 4,000 megatons. This is four billion tons of TNT, or a cube 1.3 kilometers high. To give you a sense of scale this is the cube inside Manhattan. Once the sphere arrives on Earth, this super dense matter expands instantly and creates an explosion with the force of well, the Sun. If we get the sample in Paris, in the morning the citizens of London would see what looks like a second sunrise. But, one that gets brighter and brighter, and hotter and hotter, until London burns to ashes. In a radius of about 300 kilometres around the blast, everything would be burnt. The shockwave would travel around the Earth multiple times. Most buildings in Central Europe would be flattened, eardrums would rupture, and windows break across the continent. The explosion would be apocalyptic. possibly humans civilization ending. If humans did survive, we could count on the dust blown into the atmosphere to create a small ice age. So, if there is one tiny bright side, it would be that the explosion might be an effective way to control human-caused climate change for a few decades. While this is definitely a good thing, all in all we conclude, that we should not try to bring the Sun to earth"

    "content": "Climate change is boring. Don’t get me wrong. It is incredibly important. It is just that the story of climate change\nis not especially compelling. And that is when the carbon dioxide concentration\nreached 400 parts per million. When I started making this video I thought\nthat everyone knew the story. But apparently I was wrong. What do you feel about climate change? >> So I think Australia is the most affected\nby the climate change. That is because, I would say, there are some\nlayers and layers... a hole in those layers. I think, I reckon, yeah? >> And whereas before there used to be a natural\nlayer up there that blocks things... >> That layer seems to be getting... >> It is ... it is... thinner out. Thinner something? >> Thinner, yeah. >> And so more heat is coming down. >> The ozone layer and therefore our seasons\nare changing. >> The hole in the ozone layer is causing\na problem. >> Yeah, yeah. >> Ok, the hole in the ozone layer is a problem,\nbut it is not a major cause of climate change. To recap, we are burning fossil fuels, releasing\ncarbon dioxide into the atmosphere, which traps slightly more thermal energy, causing\nthe overall temperature of the planet to rise. >> Have you changed anything about your life\nbecause climate change is happening?>> I recycle now. >> We recycle more. >> We recycle a lot in England. >> In England, yeah. >> Oh, yeah, we do more things like recycling. >> Recycling. >> Recycling. Recycling plastic and paper. >> Just putting plastics in the right bin\nand paper in the right bin and stuff like this. >> Ok, again, recycling is very important,\nbut it is not really going to reduce greenhouse gas emissions which come mainly from energy\nuse and transportation. So what I have learned is lots of people don’t\nknow how climate change works and don’t know what to do about it. What’s worse is there is so much confusion\nthat some people don't think humans are responsible. >> I am a doubter. >> What does that mean? >> It means I don’t know whether it is or\nit isn’t truth. >> You get so many conflicting opinions on\nit they all seem to be coming from reputable sources. >> Here is the thing. The vast majority of climate scientists agree\nthat climate change is happening and that humans are playing a significant role. But the public doesn’t see this broad consensus\nbecause, well, there are arguments made to the contrary by businesses with vested interests,\nthose who stand to lose if a price is put on carbon. Now these people will make up stories, whatever\nthey want, things like Al Gore and his pals just invented climate change in order to make\nthemselves rich and famous. Meanwhile the scientists respond with carefully\nworded predictions. That would result in a rising of temperature\nof between 1.4 and 2.6 degrees Celsius, that is, within a 90 percent confidence interval,\nby the year 2050. I don’t want to listen to this story again. This is why scientists have had such a tough\ntime informing the public about climate change. It is much easier to tell a compelling story\nif you can make up whatever you want than if you have to stick to the truth. Climate change is like Armageddon. Just instead of a giant earth crushing asteroid\nit is slightly more of an invisible, odorless gas. And instead of the immanent destruction of\nthe planet, it is a gradual warming over decades. See, our brains are well adapted to deal with\nclear and present danger. They are not so good at handling complex,\nlong term, probabilistic forecasts, which is kind of why we have governments. They are meant to act in our best interest,\nespecially in the case of complex, long term problems. And, in fact, last year the Australian government\nimplemented a carbon tax, which seemed to be working great. It was reducing carbon emissions. And then this year they repealed that carbon\ntax, the first government in the world to do something like that. And my question is: Why? You know, there is a UN climate summit coming\nup next month and you can actually win a trip to go there and ask your questions to the\nworld leaders. If you are between the ages of 13 and 21,\nhead over to AskWhyWHyNot.org where you can submit a one minute video asking why, why\nnot questions, like: Why would you scrap a carbon tax that was working? Why not join the rest of the world in putting\na price on carbon?I mean, the real reason I find climate change boring is because we\nknow what the problem is. The science is well established. And the solutions are fairly obvious. And yet action is not being taken. So if you feel like I do, perhaps you should\ntake some action and maybe we can change this story and make it a little bit more interesting. This video was sponsored by the Climate Reality\nProject, but it really opened my eyes because I really thought we already all knew the facts. But clearly we don’t. So maybe we need to spend more time educating\nthe people around us."

    "content": "[Applause] let's talk about the science of climate change don't you mean global warming how'd you get in here I'm the Internet I never left now why did you change the name global warming wasn't happening so you have to call it climate change well the overall average temperature of the planet is increasing so global warming is technically correct but that doesn't mean it's going to be warmer everywhere all the time and that leads to some confusion like on a cold winter's day you might say so much for global warming exactly so the term climate change indicates that the problem is more intense storms droughts and floods ocean acidification not just that the globe is warming but it's not what the globe's not warming since when 1995 that's not how you draw a trendline through data if the slope is nil the climates chill you know 13 of the 14 years occurred this century and the graph you're using is old it doesn't include satellite data if you take that into account the trend is obviously continuing upwards oh so now you say it's warming in the past scientists told us it was cooling why can't they just admit that they have no idea what's going on it's true in the 1970s there were some papers published predicting cooling but over that same time period there were six times as many papers predicting warming so scientists really haven't changed their tune well just judging by temperatures I say they're wrong the earth is cooling but you don't just have to go by the temperatures there are plenty of other signs that the globe is warming like sea levels are rising three millimeters a year that's an indication that the oceans are getting warmer and so expanding ice on Antarctica and Greenland is melting at unprecedented rates and Arctic sea ice continues to decline nah-uh Arctic sea ice increased 40% in the last two years that last little uptick that's what you focus on what about the general downward trend that could mean anything you know if the earth is warming the most likely source of the problem is the Sun the Sun is getting brighter did you ever think of that the Sun was getting brighter in the 1930s and it probably contributed to some warming then but since the 50s the Sun has been getting dimmer and temperatures continue to rise Oh see you automatically assume it's man-made co2 you know humans only emit a tiny fraction of the co2 released into the atmosphere every year that's true people emit about 30 Giga tons compared with 780 Giga tons from natural land and ocean processes so you admit it humans aren't the problem no before us the system was in balance with the land and oceans absorbing that same amount 780 Giga tons a year this balance kept carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere between 180 and 280 parts per million for 800,000 years now it's at 400 parts per million and still rising but our small contribution couldn't have caused that well the amount of co2 in the atmosphere is increasing by about 15 Giga tons or 2 parts per million every year but how do you know that's man-made co2 because the isotope carbon 13 is less common in fossil fuels than it is naturally in the atmosphere and over time we're seeing the concentrations of carbon 13 are decreasing but volcanoes emit way more co2 than humans no they don't they emit about 0.25 Giga tons annually that's less than 1% as much as human ok well even if we are responsible for the rise in co2 it doesn't matter because water is by far the most potent greenhouse gas yes it is I win no you don't water in the atmosphere is increasing as well but that can't be due to human activity the only way for the atmosphere to hold more water vapor is if it gets warmer so hang on you're not saying yes it all comes back to co2 a doubling of co2 on its own would increase the temperature of the globe by about 1 degree Celsius but that warming means there'll be more water vapor in the atmosphere and ice will melt reducing the reflectivity of Earth's surface so it's a positive feedback loop which a bunch of different sources of evidence all indicate will lead to about a 3 degrees Celsius rise in temperature but if this is true why have all the predictions failed in actuality most of the predictions show remarkable agreement with observations but you're probably thinking of the model from 19 88 back when we thought climate sensitivity was higher if you rerun that model with three degrees of warming for every doubling of co2 the predictions match exactly the warming that we've observed but the earth has warmed and cooled in the past so who is releasing co2 back then aliens we understand that past changes in the climate were triggered at regular intervals by Milankovitch cycles that is the periodic oscillation of the earth's tilt precession of the tilt and stretching and squashing of Earth's elliptical orbit during every warming cycle co2 and temperature rise together ah but if you look closely at that graph you'll see that co2 lags behind the temperature rise so it can't be causing the warming the co2 doesn't cause the first warming the Milankovitch cycles changed the way the sunlight hits the earth and that causes a little bit of warming decreasing the solubility of co2 in the oceans so some of that co2 is released and that is a positive feedback loop which amplifies the warming in fact over 90% of the temperature increase happens after the co2 starts to rise let's say you're right and the co2 we're releasing is warming the planet what's so bad about that planet gets a little warmer big deal I'm not claiming it's gonna be some sort of crazy catastrophe but we are gonna get more intense storms more droughts and floods the oceans will become more acidic sea levels will rise and my point is it would be better for all species on this planet and probably cheaper for us if we just started reducing emissions now than if we wait and pay the consequences later no thanks why are you wearing sunglasses [Music] global warming this episode of veritasium was supported by audible.com a leading provider of audiobooks with over 150,000 titles in all areas of literature including fiction nonfiction and periodicals this week I wanted to recommend the book merchants of doubt' which is about scientists who have spread misinformation about certain topics like how cigarettes cause lung cancer or how CFCs caused the ozone hole or now how co2 is causing the planet to warm so if you want to find out more about that you can download this book by going to audible.com/veritasium or you can pick any other book of your

    "content": "Do not hit the like button! Or the dislike button, at least not yet. I want you to consider a problem that's been one of the most controversial in math and philosophy over the past 20 years. There is no consensus answer. So I want you to listen to the problem and then vote for the answer you prefer using the like and dislike buttons. Okay, here is the setup: Sleeping Beauty volunteers to be the subject of an experiment. And before it starts she's informed of the procedure. On Sunday night she will be put to sleep. And then a fair coin will \nbe flipped. If that coin comes up heads, she'll be awakened on Monday and then put back to sleep. If the coin comes up Tails she will also be awakened on Monday and put back to sleep. But then she will be awakened on Tuesday as well and then put back to sleep. Now each time she gets put back to sleep \nshe will forget that she was ever awakened. In the brief period anytime she's awake she will be told \nno information. But she'll be asked one question: What do you believe is the probability that the \ncoin came up heads? so how should she answer? Feel free to pause the video and answer the question \nfor yourself right now. This was my reaction after hearing the problem for the first time. I mean the intuitive answer that pops into my head is clearly one in three. It could be the Monday when it came up heads. Or it could be the Monday when it came up Tails. Or it could be the Tuesday when it came \nup Tails. But you know what's really interesting is you just answered that the probability of a coin coming up heads is one-third. I think a lot of this comes down to what specific question is \nasked of her. What is the probability that a Fair coin flipped gives heads? That's 50 percent. What is the probability that the coin came up heads? I would say the answer is a third from her perspective. Yeah it's it's remarkably the same question. The simple reason why Sleeping Beauty should say \nthe probability of heads is one half is because she knows the coin is fair. Nothing changes between \nwhen the coin is flipped and when she wakes up and she knew for a fact that she would be woken up and \nshe receives no new information when that happens. Imagine that instead of flipping the coin \nafter she's asleep, the experimenters flip   the coin first and ask her immediately: \"what's the \nprobability that the coin came up heads?\" Well she would certainly say one half so why should \nanything change after she goes to sleep and  wakes up This is known as the Halfer position. \nBut there is another way to look at it. Others would argue that something does change when she's \nawakened. I mean it seems like she gets no new information. There are no calendars no one tells \nher anything and she knew that she would be woken up. But she actually learns something important. She learns that she's gone from existing in a reality where there are two possible states. The coin came up either heads or tails to existing in a reality where there are three possible states: Monday heads, Monday Tails or Tuesday tails. And therefore she should assign equal probability to each of these three outcomes where Heads only occurred in one. So the probability that the coin came up heads is one-third. This is known as the thirder position Now I know it seems wrong to suggest that a Fair \ncoin should have a one-third probability of coming   up heads but that's because the question she's \nasked is subtly different. The implied question   is: \"Given you're awake, what's the probability that \nthe coin came up heads?\" And that is one-third Now halfers would counter that just because there are \nthree possible outcomes doesn't mean they are each   equally likely. In the Monty Hall problem for \nexample the contestant ultimately has to choose   between two doors. But it'd be wrong to assign \nthem 50/50 odds. The prize is actually twice   as likely to be behind one door than the other. In the Sleeping Beauty problem we know a heads outcome and a Tails outcome are equally likely. So the chance of waking up on Monday with heads is 50 percent And the chance of waking up on Monday or \nTuesday with Tails should be 50 percent. Therefore the Tails probability gets split across two days 25 percent each. but if you repeat the experiment over and over, which you can try for yourself by repeatedly flipping a coin, you find she wakes up a third of the time Monday heads, a third of the time Monday tails, and a third of the time Tuesday tails, not 50-25-25 like the previous analysis would suggest. So if you were Sleeping Beauty and you were awakened and asked \"What's the probability the coin came up heads?\" What would you say? If you would say one-third then hit the like button. If you would say one half, hit the dislike button. The answer may seem obvious to you but you should know that to other people the other answer seems equally obvious. And that's why hundreds and \nhundreds of philosophy papers have been published on this problem over the past 22 years. There have been many variations of this problem like what if instead of being woken up twice if the coin lands \ntails she's instead woken up a million times? If the coin comes up heads she's still woken only \nonce. Doesn't it seem absurd in this case, when Sleeping Beauty wakes up, to say that it was just \nas likely that a coin landed heads as tails? When we know there are a million more wakeups in the \ntails case than in the heads case. I mean if you reach into a bag of one white marble and a million black marbles, what are the chances that you pull out that one white marble? I was pretty convinced \nby this and I considered myself a thirder but this same argument is used to convince people that \nwe're living in a simulation. The thinking goes that our computing technology has improved so dramatically, even over just the last 40 years, that we can imagine a time in the not-too-distant \nfuture when we can create a completely realistic simulation of our world. And once that occurs it \nshould be trivial to make unlimited copies of that simulation. And then if you were to ask someone if \nthey're living in a simulation, they would have to admit that they probably are because there are many more instances of that existence than the one true external reality. But how do we know that \nthis hasn't happened already and that we're living inside a simulation? I mean if it can happen then \nit probably has happened and we are living in a simulation This seems like the logical conclusion \nof the third or world view. Now I personally don't buy that I'm living in a simulation and I think most people don't buy it. But maybe that's just illogical bias. But there's another thought experiment that makes me seriously reconsider the third or position. Let's say there's a soccer \ngame between a really great team like Brazil and a less World dominating team like Canada. So the odds are 80:20 in Brazil's favor now a researcher is going to put you to sleep before the game \nstarts. And if Brazil wins they'll wake you up one time But if Canada wins they'll wake you up 30 \ntimes in a row and just like Sleeping Beauty you won't remember if you've been woken before. Okay so the game is about to start you fall asleep... and now you're woken up. Who do you think won the \ngame? The thirder would say Canada but I would almost certainly say Brazil. I mean why should I \ngive any weight to what the researcher would have   done if Canada had one when I'm fairly confident \nthat they won't? To extend this, let's say Brazil plays Canada five times and we do this experiment each time. Well then if you say Brazil each time you're woken up you'll probably be right about four out of five of the games. but if you said Canada every time you would be wrong about those four games but right 30 times in a row when you're   repeatedly asked about Canada's one victory. If \nyou stand to win a bet by correctly answering   the question then by all means you should bet \non Canada. But if you want to correctly pick the   winner of more of the games well then you should \nsay Brazil. And this is what's at the heart of the   dispute between Halfers and Thirders in the Sleeping \nBeauty problem. If you want to be right about the   outcome of the coin tosses well you should say the \nprobability of heads is a half but if you want to   answer more questionings correctly well then you \nshould say one-third. I want to leave you with one   last thought experiment. Imagine that you know for \na fact that before our universe began there was   a coin flip and if it came up heads only a single \nUniverse would be created. But if it came up Tails   a quasi-infinite Multiverse would be created and \nin each of those Multiverse universes you'd find   every possible variation of Earth and the people \non it In some versions there would be no Earth Now you becoming conscious is just like Sleeping \nBeauty waking up. There's no way to tell if   you're in that single universe or in one of the \nMultiverse universes but you know there are a lot   more of them. So would you think that you're for \nsure in the Multiverse. Or are the chances 50/50? The best way to develop intuition about \nprobability is by working through scenarios   or running simulations like we did for Sleeping \nBeauty. This video's sponsor Brilliant offers   probability courses that walk you through lots \nof situational probability questions. Do you want   to learn how to build your own simulations?

    "content": "- [Derek] This is the world's\nlargest rainfall simulator, located in Tsukuba, Japan. Now, I know that it just looks\nlike a warehouse with a lot of sprinklers, but this building\nis incredibly important. The science conducted here\nkeeps tens of millions of people safe, and it's only\nbecoming more and more vital. We were given exclusive\naccess to tour the facility, and they even let us\nexperience what it's like to stand under the most intense rainfall ever recorded. - [Petr] This is insane. Nope, nope, nope, nope,\nnope, nope, nope, nope. - Japan is a land of natural disasters. Most people will think\nof earthquakes, tsunamis, and volcanoes, but it also\nexperiences massive typhoons, which are like hurricanes that pick up energy from the Pacific Ocean and dump meters of rain on the islands. Yakushima Island near the\nsouthern part of Japan is one of the wettest places on Earth, receiving up to 10 meters\nof rain every year. For comparison, the Amazon\nrainforest gets only about three meters of rain per year. That's three times less\nthan Yakushima Island. Most of the time, rain isn't a problem. The water evaporates\nor seeps into the soil and is then absorbed by plants or enters the underground aquifer systems. But too much rain in a short period, like after a typhoon can\nlead to serious problems. Problems that scientists working at NIED use the rainfall\nsimulator to study and hopefully prevent. The giant warehouse is equipped with 550 nozzles attached to the roof. The scientists can control the intensity of the rain from 15 millimeters per hour to 300 millimeters per hour. The most rainfall ever\nmeasured in one hour occurred on the 22nd of June,\n1947, when 305 millimeters of rain fell on the\ntown of Holt, Missouri. So this warehouse can simulate\nthe most intense rainfall anyone has ever experienced. In a way that makes it the\nrainiest place on Earth. And honestly, I'm having a good time here in sunny Australia. So I sent Veritasium\nproducer Petr in my stead. - They're gonna turn on\nthe rain really soon. So I'm running out to grab\nmy rain jacket, I'm ready. Wow, this is so much rain. All around me, there is\nexactly 300 millimeters of rain falling every hour. We've only turned it on\nabout five minutes ago, and there's just so much rain. There's already puddles, this\nis genuinely, absolutely wild. I don't think I've ever\nexperienced anything like this before. - The nozzles at the\nsimulator contain four holes of varying diameters, so\nthey can produce raindrops of different sizes, and the\nsize of the raindrop affects how fast it falls. You've likely experienced the kind of rain with the big droplets that pelt your face or walked through a drizzle where small drops hover like mist. Because the smaller the\nraindrop, the slower it falls. There are two forces\nthat act on a raindrop, gravity and air resistance. And the larger raindrops\nhave a higher weight to surface area ratio, and so they have a\nhigher terminal velocity, so they will be falling faster. A raindrop that's one\nmillimeter in diameter falls at only about two meters per second, while a three millimeter raindrop falls at six meters per second. Air resistance is also why\nraindrops aren't shaped like cartoon raindrops. They are closer to spherical, but a bit flatter on the bottom where they encounter oncoming air. If a raindrop gets too big, it flattens out, caves in in the middle and briefly resembles a little parachute before it breaks up into smaller droplets. Flooding is something that\nJapan takes very seriously and for good reason. In July, 2018, there were\nfloods all over the country due to the rainfall\nfrom Typhoon Prapiroon. Some regions of the country\nreceived nearly two meters of rain in just 10 days, and the resulting floods were enough that more than 8 million people had to be evacuated from their homes. Over 200 people died, and the damage to property\nfrom the flooding was more than 1 trillion yen, nearly $10 billion. Tokyo, the capital city of Japan, is very vulnerable to flooding. There are more than a hundred\nrivers crisscrossing the city of nearly 40 million people. To prevent the rivers from\noverflowing, there are pipes and tunnels under the city leading to an enormous water storage tank. In October, 2019, typhoon Hagibis dumped over\n200 millimeters of rain onto the city in under 48 hours. The underground system diverted\n12 million cubic meters of water and prevented an\nestimated $1.7 billion in damage. But flooding isn't the only problem. Japan is a very mountainous\ncountry with many towns and villages situated in valleys. So combined with the heavy rainfall, this creates the perfect\nconditions for another hazard. (man screaming) The researchers at NIED have\nidentified over 700,000 places where landslides are a\nsignificant threat to homes. But landslides are so complicated. There are so many factors that affect if a landslide will occur, how large it could be,\nhow fast it will move, and how much damage it will do. Not just the slope angle\nor the amount of new rain, but the type of soil,\nthe minerals present, and the vegetation growing\non top of the slope. This is footage from a landslide that occurred in Norway in June of 2020. There's barely any slope angle here, but the whole area sits\non a layer of quick clay, an incredibly unstable clay\nlayer, which when exposed to intense rainfall loses\nits structural integrity, becoming a liquid. In the case of this landslide,\nthere were no casualties, though several homes\nwere swept out to sea. The complexity of the physics of landslides is why the work done at the large scale rainfall\nsimulator is so important. The best way to minimize\nlandslide damage is prevention, and it's the same for cybersecurity. Creating strong passwords,\nusing anti-malware protection, backing up your data and\nupdating your operating system and software regularly. Something that's particularly useful is a virtual private network\nlike today's sponsor, NordVPN. NordVPN hides your IP address and helps protect your online identity. Petr filmed on location in Japan and he used NordVPN to safely\naccess public wifi hotspots. And I am currently in Australia, and I've been using\nNordVPN to watch NHL games 'cause I think the\nCanucks have a real shot at the cup this year. Something I especially\nlike about NordVPN is that their speeds are blisteringly fast. So it's effortless to just\nkeep it turned on all the time. High speeds are particularly\nuseful when you're connecting to streaming services and hopping on servers in distant\nlocations to watch content that's only available in those regions.

There's a 30 day money back guarantee, so it's entirely risk free. Just go to nordvpn.com/veritasium. So I wanna thank NordVPN\nfor sponsoring this part of the video, and now back to the world's largest rainfall simulator. - All right, I'm gonna try\nit without an umbrella. I have a very nice, very nice jacket. I'm not sure how it's gonna\nhold up, but we're gonna try. (Petr screaming) Oh my God, this is insane. Nope, nope, nope, nope,\nnope, nope, nope, nope. My jacket is waterproof, so I was fine. But my jeans are\nabsolutely soaked through. - [Derek] To study landslides, the whole warehouse\nhas a secret, it moves. - [Peter] The rainfall simulator can be in one of five positions. - Velocity is about one\nmeter per one minute. - One meter per minute. Wow, it moves on these railway tracks. Every time you move it, you need to grab this gigantic\nwrench and undo these bolts. This is the pipe that connects all the water up to the sprinklers. There's a number of these kind of openings in the pipe along the line. So when you move it, you just connect it to a different part. So this is the landslide testing facility? - Yes, this is a 30 degree\nslope, you can see this. This is a shallow landslide. Now you can put the soil\nhere, about one meter. - [Petr] You would put all\nthe sand and all the soil, and then you'd bring the building over. You'd move it over here. And then you'd start raining on it. - Yes. - [Dr. Sakai] 20 degrees\nthis slope, is 20 degrees. - Right, so you have a 30, a 40, and a 20, 20, 30, 40.\n- Yes. - [Derek] So what causes landslides? Well, a slope will slide when the force of gravity pulling it down becomes greater than the force of friction holding it up. - There's a misnomer out there that water makes the materials\nslipperier, so it rains and it soaks into the ground\nand it makes it slipperier. That's not true, water's\nactually an anti lubricant for many materials, including quartz, which is our most common\nmineral in soils and on earth. - [Derek] So water doesn't\nmake soil slipperier, but soil is porous. There are grains and there are\npores between those grains. And as it rains, the\nwater seeps into the soil, the pores become filled with water, and as it keeps raining, the water pressure in the pores increases, which decreases the\nfriction between the grains. For a slope that was\nalready at risk of sliding, this decrease in friction\nis what ultimately leads to the slope breaking\napart and sliding downhill. - One thing that our\nmathematical models are not very well developed at yet is determining is it going to slide slowly or is it going to slide\nor maybe flow rapidly? That's a tough one, that's, so\nexperimentation's a great way of getting at that. And you know, the scaler effects are huge. So many people have a\nlittle model in their lab, you know, a small scale flume, but now you're dealing\nwith materials, you know, you're starting to get off scale. A large scale stimulation\ndevice like they have in Japan is really important. - [Derek] So how can\nyou prevent landslides? Well, there are a few things you can do, like using steel beams and\nmesh to anchor the slope. Or you can dig up the\ntop layer of the soil to decrease the slope angle. And when it's expected\nthat a slope will slide after too much rain, engineers\ndrill holes into the slope and place pipes to drain the water out. Another solution is to\ncreate catchment zones and diversion channels,\nbig holes in the ground that will catch or divert the landslide before it hits a residential area. Trees are incredibly effective\nat preventing landslides. Not only do their roots\nprovide great anchors, they draw the water up from\nthe soil to be evaporated away, which effectively drains the soil and decreases the water level. (chainsaw operating) Where steep slopes have been deforested for the timber industry,\nlandslides have become more common. Over the last few decades, there has been a tenfold\nincrease in landslides in the forests of British Columbia. - Humans are really good\nat causing landslides and we're shaping the land a heck of a lot more quickly than\ngeologic processes do. So when we excavate over\nhere or add more weight or more landslide or\nmore material over here, and that triggers landslides\nvery, very regularly. Study in Seattle from Seattle,\nWashington a few decades ago, showed that I think more than 85% had at least partial human\ntrigger, if you will. - [Derek] While the focus\nof the work is primarily on landslide study and prevention, the simulator is also used to test how drones fly in rainy\nand windy conditions. It's also used to test self-driving cars. The data is used to improve the hardware and software of how the\ncars detect various objects. The two main ways that self-driving\ncars detect other cars, traffic lights and\npedestrians is with cameras or LIDAR sensors. In both cases, rain can\ndecrease the visibility and accuracy of these sensors. So testing them in a perfectly\nrepeatable environment helps engineers develop solutions to these weather challenges. - In Japan, the rainfall\ncondition is changing. And now in this century, the rainfall condition\nis so many heavy rainfall in so much short time. - [Derek] As the world heats\nup due to humanity's addiction to fossil fuels, extreme weather events\nare becoming more common. Compared to 30 years ago, the\nnumber of rain events in Japan with an intensity of\n50 millimeters per hour have become 40% more common. Rainfall at double that intensity has become 70% more common. Climate change will increase\nthe rate of flooding and the occurrence of\nlandslides in the future, which is why the work done at the world's largest rainfall\nsimulator is becoming more and more important. But I hope that humanity\nfocuses its efforts on addressing the root\ncauses of climate change and not just on the mitigation\nof its negative impacts."

    "content": "So this is like the world's most important freezer? It is. Really. *laughs* The most important room in the world, someone has said. These are pretty big claims for a place located just 1300 km, or 800 miles from the north pole. But then, this is no ordinary place. It's the Svalbard Global Seed Vault. Well, actually, this is just it's front door. Inside the seed vault are a series of tunnels. It's not actually that cold right here, but as we go deeper, it is only going to get colder. This is Bente You're an engineer, Bente? Yes, I am Are you gonna show us where to go? *chuckles* Yeah Fantastic How many doors are there? One, two, three, four, five doors until we are into the secret room. Five doors to the secret room Woah. That's what I'm talking about. These are the lenghts of tunnel that take you down into the seed vault. This facility was built to last around 200 years and withstand earthquakes and explosions. It was placed on the side of a mountain so even if all the ice on earth melts it will still be above sea level. There are three separate vault rooms where seeds are stored but only one of them is in use right now. And it's buried over 120 meters from the front door. The whole point of putting the vaults so deep in this mountain is to put it within permafrost. So, all around me, the earth naturally stays around -4 or -5 all year round. And, that way, if something did happen and the cooling stopped flowing here, there was no power. Then, well, behind these doors it would still remain probably, you know, -4 or -5 Celsius, forever. Assuming, of course, global temperatures don't rise that much. This place is sometimes called \"The Doomsday Vault\", because even in a worst case scenario it should preserve the diversity of the world's food crops. Now we are really in the mountain. Surrounded by permafrost. And, here's a cross tunnel that leads to three vault doors. Vault number 1 is up there Vault number 2, and this is the one that is actually being used. And then, vault number 3. It's pretty amazing to look up and see ice covered ceilings and walls everywhere. The Svalbard Global Seed Vault works essentially like a bank vault? Yes, it's almost, yeah, because the seeds lay in the boxes like this. These boxes are sealed when they come to Svalbard. And none of us can open it We put it through the security system at the airports just to check that it isn't any explosives or anything in it. But it works like a bank box. We can't open this. Only the depositor can open and take out their seeds So you don't open any of the seeds, any of the boxes that come here? No. Well. How do you know that people are really deposing the seeds, like barely they say they are not, and other things? Just because they have signed the contract. That's it. We can't be sure about it. Of course, we trust them. Would there be seeds for some crops that people might consider illicit, like marijuana That is said that that shall not be in here. No drugs and also no gene-modified material No genetically modified seeds go in here? Yeah, Norway has asked for that no genetical material is kept in here. Are there any particularity strange crops? Has anyone deposited anything that is really odd or weird? Ahhh.. No, nothing weird is in here, but we get some questions from people that wants to put in their own private seeds. I've also has had letters from men wanting to put their gene material in here. That is really strange and we don't answer those. This is the door to the vault and behind here, there are nearly a million different varieties of seeds, from all over the world, kept at minus 18 degrees Celsius. You know how I can tell that it's minus 18°C in here? You can actually feel the moisture in your nose freeze so, Your nostrils get all stiff... Yeah, And I see behind you we have some Canadian seeds, which is exciting for me because I am Canadian. So what sort of things do we have... From Canada, I'm really not... Not sure because... This box... On the outside doesn't tell what's in it, but, These numbers here are connected to a database on the internet so you can go in there afterwards. Derek: There you go.  Bente: Yeah You can go find out what has Canada got stored in the Seed Vault. What are we looking at right here. It's like a bank vault except everything that you've put in there is publicly available. Yeah, it is. (chuckles) These are the coolest boxes I think. They are from North Korea. Derek: Oh my goodness!                                                                         Bente: Wooden hand made boxes Derek: They look like they come from the 1960s or something. Do you think? Bente: Yeah, they do. Derek: They built them specially. Bente: They built them specially because they got the measurements of how big should the boxes be and these are built exactly of those measurements. And here you see that North Korea is placed on the same shelf as USA, it's just on the back there. It's on the back side. And you have South Korea, just on the back. So here there are like in a small United Nations, deep in the mountains of Svalbard. (Chuckles) So these are the last few bare shelves in Vault 2. Once the other two vaults are full, there will be around 3 million different species of plants stored here with over 500 seeds per sample. So one day, there may be over a billion seeds stored inside this mountain, representing the vast majority of Earth's agricultural diversity. And you don't know today what kind of seeds that you can grow in 20, 30, 40 years from now, because of the climate change. Perhaps you have to use another type of seed thirty years from now that can handle warmer climate, dryer climate, wetter climate, whatever is going to happen. So that is why it's so important to have a backup of all the seeds so that you are sure that you can also grow the food we need, for the next generations to come. But this isn't the only seed bank on Earth. There are around 1700 other gene banks around the world, run by different countries and organizations. And, at a cost of $9 million to build the Svalbard seed vault and millions more to run it, it's worth asking whether this is a costly redundancy, or a valuable insurance policy. And perhaps, the best people to answer this question are the Syrians, who, last year, were the first to make a withdrawal from the seed vault. The gene bank in Aleppo, in Syria, is now out of order, it's been bombed. So one third of the material that is kept in here is now taken down to Morocco and Lebanon. And this is some of the material that now has been returned, so to get the material going again. So that's why it's empty. Will those seeds actually be used to grow crops? Yeah, they will. Yeah. Over the last 13 thousand years we have cultivated millions of species of plants. The agricultural revolution underpinned the technological and population explosions that made our modern lives possible. The risk of a real Doomsday scenario is incredibly remote. But, whatever happens, thanks to this outpost at the top of the world at least our seeds are safe. Hey, I'm currently on a train traveling from Washington, D.C. to New York City so I can't talk to loud. And actually after Norway, I went to Seoul, South Korea, Los Angeles, Boston , New York and Washington, so it's been some crazy travels for me. And on all these travels I've been listening to audio books from Audible who also support Veritasium which I am very thankful for. If you didn't know already, Audible has like 250,000 titles in all areas of literature, including fiction, non-fiction and periodicals. And if you go to Audible.com/veritasium you can get a 30 day free trial of the website where you can just try out listening to a book. So if you are at all interested in listening to audio books, I highly recommend you check them out. And there is a book I can recommend to you, it is my favorite fiction book of all time. It's called \"Everything is Illuminated\" by Jonathon Safran Foer. It is-  I don't know, its just such a complex interwoven novel, you have to read it or listen to it to know what i mean. But you can check it out. You can download that book for free for a one month trial or you can pick any other book of your choosing. So, I really want to thank Audible for supporting me and helping me go to all these amazing places. And I want to thank you for watching."

    "content": "When I was outside on my first space walk,\nI was on the dark side of the world over the Indian Ocean and I shut off all the lights\nin my suit to let my eyes adjust. And as I came south of Australia in the darkness,\nwe drove through the southern lights and they were like pouring underneath my feet and you\ncould see all the colors of it and, I mean, I had seen aurora from on the surface of the\nearth, but to be amongst them, to actually directly be part of that interaction between\nthe sun and the atmosphere and the magnetic field all right there visually like a prism\nor a rainbow or something, that was a real reality check of how it is all related and\nhow the energy of the sun and the protection of the atmosphere and the focus of the magnetic\nfield all work together. It really showed me that this is a system. This is a planetary system. This goes on all the time. Most of the time, though, we just don’t\nsee it, but this is going on constantly, all the time, how all those things work together. From orbit you get that type or perspective. You see the fact that this is a complicated\nsystem that is subject to a lot of influences, that is going on all the time. One of the influences that is affecting earth\nitself, of course, is the beings that are living on it. Volcanoes erupting, but also the plant life\nand the animal life. And over the last 100 years, I mean, gosh,\nour numbers have rocketed until seven billion of us are ell simultaneously exhaling and\neating and turning on our lights in our house and starting up the engines in our cars. Obviously that has an effect on the planet\nin amongst all those other things happening. You can see some of those effects from space. You can see with your naked eye. If you come across Mexico City or Beijing,\nthe pollution is visible from space. It is like a grey, ugly smear on the surface\nof the world. That this man made local climate change. If you come across Asia... On my very first flight there was a big inland\nsea, the Aral Sea. It was still a relatively healthy body of\nwater back in the early 90s. But over the last 20 years, because of agricultural\npolicies and irrigation policies, the Aral Sea has gone from being the fourth biggest\nsea on earth, to being virtually non-existent. It is dried up. And we did it on purpose as a species. We made a conscious decision to allow the\nfourth biggest sea in the world to turn into a little stinking puddle. What used to be a shore line is now empty\nsand and the remains of the fertilizer that were drained into that sea for decades. We are obviously changing the climate at a\nglobal level. The key is: Who is going to be the person\nthat is going to decide to change something? We can’t wait for some other person to change\nit. They don’t have the imperative to do it,\nespecially if they are someone that we elected. If we elected, they are just our representative\nand the real motivation comes to each of us individually. That is who has to make the change. You can’t say they or him or her or it. It is us or me or I that has to make the change. And it is not going to be perfect and it is\ngoing to have to get a little bit critical before people are truly going to feel enough\npain or enough compunction to actually change what they are doing. And things are going to get worse before they\nget better. But I am confident this isn’t the end of\nthe world. This is just a problem that we are facing\nthat is going to change things, but we are going to have to figure out a way to deal\nwith it. >> I am just... >> Got enough light? >> Yeah, I am wondering if the sun is setting\non us there. >> We can turn... >> I... >> The sun is not only setting on us."

    "content": "Derek: So how did it feel to make this\nprediction and then have the world essentially not listen\nand not prepare? Bill Gates: Well there's no good feeling that comes\non something like this saying i told you so If anything kills over 10 million people in the next few decades,\nit's most likely to be a highly infectious virus\nrather than a war. You know I just think back and could I have been more persuasive? We've actually invested very little\nin a system to stop an epidemic. We're not ready for the next epidemic. Derek: How did you make such a prescient prediction? How did you know this was\ngoing to happen? BG: Well there's a number of respiratory\nviruses and from time to time one will come along\nthat's very transmissive and causes some level of fatalities. Respiratory diseases are very scary because you're still walking around\non a plane, a bus when you're infectious unlike some other diseases like ebola\nwhere you're mostly in a hospital bed by the time the viral\nload infects other people. Derek: Hey, so recently i got the chance to interview Bill Gates when his foundation's annual\nletter came out I'll link to it in the description and\nwe talked about lots of things including conspiracy theories and misinformation\nbut about the pandemic i wanted to know if so many people could see this coming\nand the costs of prevention were relatively small then\nwhy wasn't more done about it? BG: Well there's some risks like earthquakes\nwhere we see small earthquakes all the time. Or you know the history of war or fire or hurricanes so you don't forget. These pandemics only come along so irregularly  that being lulled into a sense of\nsecurity where it probably won't be a problem in the next few years, why should\nwe put money into that? You don't buy the insurance policy,\nbasically. This one will help us understand it\nneeds to be a priority. Derek: I feel like humans have an issue though\nwith fighting the last battle potentially, so\nif we focus on pandemics now and there isn't one say for another hundred years What is the next disaster? What is the one that we're not prepared for? BG: Well I'd point out two: One is climate change. Every year that would be a death toll even greater than we've had in this\npandemic. Also, related to pandemics is something\npeople don't like to talk about much which is bioterrorism, that\nsomebody who wants to cause damage could engineer a virus and so that means the cost the chance of running into this\nis more than just the naturally cost epidemics like the current one. Derek: It feels to me like there's something similar about\npandemics and you know climate change or like asteroid impact, which is that you\nknow they're not very tangible but you could do a little bit.  I don't know it seems like humans are not very good at those sorts of problems. BG: Well my favorite writer, Vaclav Smil,\nyou know wrote about all the potential kinds of disasters like you know\nthe risk of an asteroid, the risk of a you know yellowstone-like eruption\nand in fact he showed that pandemics were significantly\nthe biggest thing other than a human-caused nuclear war\nthat we needed to be more prepared for Derek: So what changes do we put in place\nto be readier for the next one and is it possible that covid-19 could be the\nlast global pandemic? BG: Well certainly there will be more pandemics. \nThe ways that humans interact with other species, these viruses are coming across\na species barrier whether it's from bats or monkeys or Derek: but you don't think we could increase our preparedness to such\na level that it never sort of becomes this global\nissue? BG: We could increase our preparedness so we\nnever have a death toll uh anywhere near what we have today.  You know pandemics can be worse in terms of the fatalities. Smallpox was a\nover 30 per cent fatality. You know so a little bit we were lucky that the fatality here\nis not not super high but we can nip it in the\nbud it'll still get to a lot of countries but the number\nof deaths you know uh with the right system should be a\ntenth of what we we've seen here. Derek: And the systems that you want to put in\nplace so this sort of so you can nip it in the bud or\nso what are the key elements that we didn't have that we should have\ngoing forward?  BG: I would divide it into two sections: There's the field based activity and the R&D activity. In R&D we need to mature mRNA\nso we can make it even faster and have factories all over the world, have it be cheap and thermal stable. There's a lot that can go into\ntherapeutics including antibodies. On diagnostics having the ability to give 10 million PCR tests a day. Then in terms of the field we need a lot of diagnostic machines all over\nthe world. We need a team of epidemiologists. So the\ninvestments are about equal between R&D and the the field-based group and information that should beconstantly flowing. Derek: You know I feel like there's a meta-issue that is kind of above\nall of these issues which is you know the way that people connect with\nreality and figure out what's true and what's not and you know what information\nto believe. I've got to say that you know as i was\ngrowing up and coming into this information age it seemed like the\nInternet and all these tools were going to make\nthe correct information so much more easy to access and\nbring us into a more fact-based world. Instead it doesn't look as though it's\nbringing us there. I wonder if you shared a similar vision\nfor you know what the Internet might do for\nall of us and i don't know if you have any thoughts\nabout the current state of it you know how do we deal with this? BG: Well the internet has done something fantastic which is if you want to learn\nyou know the people who watch you are you know getting an opportunity to\nunderstand science and what's going on and that\njust wasn't there uh and so for a lot of people they're\nso much more informed. I mean I have friends who ask me about these variants\nwhere I'm just stunned at how up to date they are with the latest\ninformation so for people who want to learn facts this\nis a golden age. You know we focus on the negative part\nwith some of these conspiracy theories and anti-factual things\nand so because social media is so new figuring out how you\ncurb that, you know labeling it restrict the speed of spread of things that are\ntitillating but false. We are missing some good ideas to\nyou know not have this kind of scary phenomena that in the case of\nanti-vaccine things may slow down how quickly we get lots of\npeople uh to take the vaccine and therefore\nextend the epidemic and and cost us in in tens of thousands of lives. Derek: It feels like you're running up against\nyou know kind of that great American principle of free speech,\nright? I think it's a great point that you bring up that you know in the\npast the problem was kind of scarcity getting access to this sort of\ninformation and now it's sort of a problem of too much and figuring out\nwhich is the good stuff and which is not. BG: Well there are certainly\nclear things like you know saying completely false things about you know\nvaccines but there is kind of a gray area in the middle\nthat figuring out what the rules are and who should be the one looking\nand interpreting those rules Wow, we are missing that today.\nYou know can you get a group of experts that are weighing in on these things you\ndon't really want the profit motive involved But you want you know expertise and capacity and so\nyou know a few years from now i hope we're more sophisticated on\nwhat or how that line should be drawn Derek: you know a while back on my second\nchannel I made a video called Be Hated, which was kind of about my\nthoughts about pushing back against misinformation, that we should\nsee anything that is wrong in the world and we should do our best to fight it so\nyou should not be liked by everyone because there are some people out there\nwith bad ideas and you should be pushing back against them. That was\nessentially my thought but since then I feel like my views have softened a\nlittle and now I think of our pushing back\nagainst misinformation a little bit like an immune system. Obviously it's a\nproblem if your immune system is weak if it doesn't respond to anything\nbut it's also a problem if your immune system is too strong.\nYou know during the 1918 flu pandemic there's a really interesting\ndistribution of deaths where the young and old\nwere more likely to die obviously because they have weak immune systems\nbut also people in the sort of 25 to 35 year-old range because their immune\nsystems were just so strong they were overactive and that ended up\nresulting in mortality so I feel like there's a sweet spot in\nterms of how much we push back against misinformation.\nYou know you'll never see me make a video about\nflat earthers because i just don't see the point.\nYou know making that video only kind of reconfirms their world view and there's\nnot really any minds to move there so that's kind of how I'm conceptualizing misinformation these days,\na bit like we have to be a targeted immune system. So i wanted to push Bill a bit further on this idea and I brought up a tweet\nthat I had seen doing the rounds on twitter that basically said\nthat the Oxford vaccine development, they were going to open source that vaccine\nuntil the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation\ngot involved and said no you must partner exclusively with a\nbig pharma company AstraZeneca and so obviously it seems to the people\non twitter that something nefarious was going on there, but I wanted to know from Bill what was the real story BG: Well the making a safe vaccine is more complicated than say making a\njet engine and people are very picky about\nvaccines in fact you could ruin the reputation of vaccines if you're making\nthem in factories where the quality control at every stage\nis not exquisite. and you know any mistake you know you\ncan have that factory shut down literally for months\nat a time when its output is needed to save millions of lives.\nSo vaccine factories are not something that you just you know\nyou know like open source code that you can take and you know mess around with\nand so the the limitations on how many vaccines are being made, that's\nbased on how many great capable vaccine manufacturers there are\nin the world and we've made sure that the AstraZeneca's being made in these\nbig indian factories and there's no royalty for that,\nno charge at all. Now we've had to fund that, the Gates Foundation.\nThese are companies we've been working on their factory quality for over a\ndecade so that there was spare capacity to\nmake inexpensive vaccines so Oxford University is is wonderful,\nbut they're not capable of doing a phase three trial\nand they they don't have factories We did tell\nOxford that they needed to seek somebody with expertise\nand AstraZeneca came in and we didn't control that agreement but they came in\nand said hey they want to do it on a non-profit basis\nand I'm impressed with how they put their best people on it and helped out.\nYou know the pharma companies who didn't get involved\nnobody's criticizing them. So you know you feel sorry for the ones that are\nreally miraculously helping make these\nvaccines. These are the very good reasons that I\nsuspect exist but that that's where I feel like social\nmedia just doesn't get the nuance and you know it pains me to see\nthe world like that. And you know even to see you, Bill,\nyou know be the target of some of these conspiracy theories It seems to not bother you but you know\nit kind of bothers me as a guy who wants you know everyone to live in the same\nkind of reality and you know I see you out there doing great things and I\nthink that you know that should be commended as opposed to\nwhat you get. I'm not in a position to complain much you know\nI have a lot of things that you know make me extremely lucky\nand you know I hope these conspiracy theories go away\nand I don't know what what it'll mean for the future. Derek: How do you feel about the vaccine roll-out so far?  BG: Well we you know we need the supply,  we need the logistics and we need the\ndemand and there are huge challenges in each of\nthose. I'm hopeful that Johnson and Johnson in\nthe next month will get approved because that's a single dose vaccine,\nvery cheap highly scalable so AstraZenica, Johnson and Johnson and a\nfew months later Novovax. Most of the developing world, those are the vaccines\nthat will be going to them and so we put billions into trying to\nmake that happen and you know in a few months hopefully it'll\ncome together."

    "content": "(brooding music) - Most plane doors aren't locked. There are no keys, no sensors\nor passcodes to secure them. If someone wants to pull\nthe lever, they can. - A man opened the emergency exit door and forced his way off the plane. - And yet with 40 million\nflights each year, these doors are virtually\nnever opened in flight. So, why not? - Your self preservation, surely. - Common sense. - Most people are, you know, smart enough to not mess with that. - The real answer relies\non where planes fly. - How high do planes fly approximately? - 10,000 km or\nis that overshooting it? - I think that's overshooting it. I think you'd be in space. - 25,000 km. That's the height of a plane flying? - Is that way too low? - It's too much. It's too much. Too much. Too much. Bring it down. - Maybe yeah, 1,000 km? - 1,000 km, still space. - 50,000 ft, I think. - Yeah, some of them can\ngo up to 43,000 ft. - 30,000 ft. - 38,000 ft. - Yeah. Why do they fly that high? Uhh... - I don't know. Safety, I guess. - Probably to avoid\ncollision with other aircraft and if there's high mountain ranges. - I don't know,\nwhen storms or weather hit? - My guess is to avoid\nthe turbulent weather. - I think that's a decent guess. Now, it's true that one of the benefits of flying at 30,000 ft is a smoother ride. This is high in the troposphere, the layer in which most weather occurs. So, there's less turbulence and fewer storms to navigate around. But this is not the main\nreason that planes fly so high. The bigger reason, of course, is money. As you go up, the density of air decreases and at 33,000 ft or 10 km, the density of air is just a third of what it is at sea level. So flying at this altitude, the plane runs into a third\nof the air molecules it would closer to the ground. That means the plane\ncan fly about 73% faster for the same amount of thrust. And as a result, you get\nto your destination faster and since you spend less time in the air, you burn less fuel. It seems in a way that like\nclimbing is wasted energy. Can you compare like the\ndescent to the ascent? Do you essentially get the energy back as you fall down the other side? - Yeah. When we climb, we burn\nabout 80 kilos per minute. In cruise, we burn about\n40 kilos per minute. And in descent, it's maybe 10. So, it's almost negligible. - Not only that, jet engines\nare more efficient at altitude. They work by compressing\nair at the intake, mixing it with fuel and igniting it. So, the combustion products\nare ejected very fast from the exhaust nozzle. Now, this process is more\nefficient the colder the air is. And at altitude, the temperature is around minus 50 degrees Celsius, which is a lot colder\nthan an average of plus 15 here at the ground. So, flying higher means you\nburn less fuel for less time and avoid the weather\nand associated turbulence of lower altitudes. - The other reason you wanna fly high is to take advantage of\nthe jet stream tailwinds and the company likes people who do that, because you're burning less fuel, so it's less money. - But there is a problem\nwith flying this high. The air up there is unbreathable. If you were suddenly teleported to the top of Mount Everest, a\nheight lower than planes fly, you would remain conscious\nfor only about three minutes. This is because in addition to density dropping with\naltitude, so does air pressure. Air pressure actually falls off faster, because it depends on the\nweight of all the air above you. So at 10 km, the air pressure is only a quarter of\nwhat it is at sea level. To be clear, the air is still 21% oxygen, but the partial pressure of oxygen, the pressure exerted\nsolely by oxygen molecules is around 5.5 kilopascals, which is a quarter of\nwhat it is on the ground. Now at this pressure, not\nenough oxygen molecules can force their way into\nyour blood in your lungs. To function normally, humans\nneed an oxygen partial pressure of at least 16 kilopascals. So, all the cabins of airplanes that cruise at high altitude\nmust be pressurized. A little bit of air is\ncontinuously brought into the cabin from outside. It actually comes in from\nthe compression stage of the jet engines. That is what maintains\nbreathable air inside the plane. - The downside is that you are taking away a little bit of the\nefficiency of the engines. - Now, pressurizing the cabin required a radical redesign of aircraft. Before pressurization, planes would fly up to 10,000 feet or\naround three kilometers, where the partial pressure\nof oxygen is 15 kilopascals, just at the limit of\nwhat people can handle. On these planes, doors opened outward and there wasn't much concern\nabout the seal around them since the pressure was\nthe same on both sides. But once planes were pressurized, all the doors were changed\nto be the shape of a plug. They're wider on the\ninside than the outside. That way the higher\npressure inside the cabin pushes the door into its frame,\ncreating an airtight seal. How airtight is a cabin? - It's pretty airtight, but\nnot completely airtight. So,  you'll notice for example, every time that someone\nflushes the toilet, you'll see some of the\nair pressure go down. So every time that happens, you can actually see the cabin\naltitude jump a little bit. - And this is why plane doors\nand emergency exit doors don't need locks. The difference in pressure\nbetween the pressurized cabin and the low pressure exterior is so great that no one is strong enough\nto pull the door inwards. And if someone had come up and turned that while\nyou're mid-flight?  Nothing. - Even modern plane\ndoors that open outward are shaped like plugs. They're just cleverly designed. The main passenger door on a Boeing 737 is both wider and taller\nthan the frame it needs to pass through. But when you pull the lever, gates at the top and bottom fold in, reducing the height just enough. However, the sides are still too wide. So, the door first has\nto pop inside and rotate. It's that movement inwards\nthat is impossible at altitude. It would require a force equivalent to lifting 9,000 kilograms. And airplane cabins aren't\neven fully pressurized to the sea level pressure\nof 101.3 kilopascals. You may have noticed this if you take a bag of chips on a plane. It's easy to squish on the ground but as the plane climbs, the\npressure in the cabin drops and the chip bag seems to\ninflate like a balloon. I measured the pressure in my plane and at cruising altitude, the pressure dropped to 77 kilopascals. Meaning the partial pressure of oxygen  was only 16 kilopascals, the minimum required for people\non the plane to feel normal. This has some unintended consequences. Do you think you fart more in a plane? (interviewee laughing) - If I did, I'd blame someone else. - I feel like no. - No. - No - I can't let it rip, no way in the world. Do you think you fart more in\na plane than on the ground? - A hundred percent, no hesitation. Sure, I mean it's gotta do\nwith the cabin pressure, right? - So as you go up, that\ncavity in here now expands and the air wants to go somewhere, and the quickest place it can go is south. - Bag of chips just popped by itself. - Now, the International\nSpace Station is pressurized to sea level pressure, 101.3 kilopascals. So, why are planes pressurized to the minimum extent possible to carry human passengers? Well, it's actually\nfor a very good reason. In 1988, Aloha Airlines 243 was en route from Hilo\nto Honolulu, Hawaii. The cabin was being\npressurized as we've described, but unfortunately, this plane's\nfuselage had a small crack and all of a sudden at 24,000 feet, the crack widened and the whole roof tore off the front of the plane. Miraculously the pilots\nwere able to land safely and only one person was killed. The difference between the\nInternational Space Station and a plane is that the\nISS was pressurized once and it stays pressurized. But a plane experiences\na pressure difference every time it climbs to cruising altitude. So, the fuselage is stretched and then relaxed with every flight. Stretched and relaxed,\nstretched and relaxed. The Aloha Airlines plane had the second highest 737\nflight cycle count in the world, with nearly 90,000 in total. That's way more than it was designed for. This led to fatigue, cracking, corrosion, and the eventual explosive decompression. So, planes are pressurized\nto the least extent possible to minimize stresses and\nextend the life of the plane. But even 75% of atmospheric pressure should be plenty to prevent\nthe doors from opening. So, how did this happen in May, 2023? - A passenger panicked\nand actually managed to open an Airbus\nemergency exit in flight. They were on final approach and they were quite close to the ground, so the pressure differential\nwas very little. And because of him using all of his force, he actually managed to get\nthe door open, which was crazy and we didn't think\nthat that was possible. But if you want something\nbad enough, I guess it is. - Wow. Was he okay? - He was okay. Everyone\nwas okay in that case. - That was a pretty serious mishap. So, I guess the next logical question is:  Have any other passengers\ninadvertently caused a mishap,  by say, forgetting to put\ntheir phone on airplane mode? When you're sitting there on the tarmac and they come on and tell you to put your phone on\nairplane mode, do you do it? And why do they get us to do that? What is the reason? Is there a reason? - Obviously, they\nwouldn't ask you to do it if it wasn't for some benefit. - I'm unfortunately a bit of a rebel and I don't follow the rules and yeah. - But you're not worried\nabout taking the plane down? - I'd make sure my parents\nhave the airplane mode on so I can have it off. - I mean, yes I do because\nI don't want it interfering with like the radio or whatever. - Well, I think it's the\ncommunication interference. - I feel like I've always been told like it messes up like instruments, but honestly you're\nalways just told to do it. So you know, just gotta put\nyour phone in  airplane mode. - In 1961, the Federal\nAviation Administration or FAA found that some portable FM radios could interfere with\nplane navigation systems since they used neighboring radio bands. And out of caution, they banned almost all personal\nelectronics on flights. But airlines could test\nany device for interference and overrule the FAA ban\nto allow it on board. Any device, that is, except a phone, because another organization\nhas jurisdiction over phones and that's the Federal\nCommunications Commission, or FCC. See a phone on the ground with buildings and hills around it can usually only see\none or two cell towers at the same time. But from the air, it could\nsee 10 or 20 or more. The concern was that 200 phones traveling at 800 kilometers\nper hour in a plane could rapidly connect\nto many towers at once, overloading the infrastructure. At least that's what the\nFCC thought could happen. So, they banned cell phone\nuse in flight in 1991. (funky music) But there's a problem with this theory. A plane is a big metal enclosure, essentially a Faraday cage. So, it should block almost\nall electromagnetic signals. That's why plane antennas\nare located on the outside. Your phone signals can only\nescape through the windows, which means they go horizontally\nout the sides of the plane. So, they would have to\ntravel long distances before reaching the ground. And the cell towers your\nphone is trying to connect to, well they are tilted downwards, you know, to collect all the signals from people walking around on the ground. So, it's very hard to make\na connection from the air unless you're flying really low. So, phones could only conceivably\ndisrupt ground networks during takeoff or landing. And the FCC never even\ntested if this was the case. In 2005, they went\nbefore Congress and said the rule banning 800 MHz\ncell phone use in flight may not be needed in order to protect ground-based cellular networks. As far as we know, a mobile phone has never\ncaused an air accident. All airplane mode does for\nsure is save your battery life. So, why are these rules still around? - I've been flying myself and where I've gotten interference, you know, when you're\ntalking to a traffic control and you get that\n(imitating a phone signal), you know that signal, and that is because someone\nis either using their phone or the phone is on. Will one phone in an\naircraft cause any problems? Probably not. Will 200 do something? Maybe. Rather than taking the\nchance of like, let's everyone update their Twitter profile at 500 feet, rather than saying that, we're saying no, you know, just keep them off, you know, enjoy the Wi-Fi up at\naltitude and that's it. - But airplane mode might\nsoon be a thing of the past. The EU actually no longer requires it and is pushing for airlines\nto provide 5G service on all EU flights. So, we may eliminate that inconvenience, but we still have to\ndeal with airplane food. What do you think about airplane food? - I only eat the bread rolls. That's only thing I can handle. Apart from that, everything\ntastes like mush. - It's can be very good.\nIt can be very terrible. - Eh, bland-ish, different consistency. - Do you think the food\ntastes as good in a plane as it would on the ground? - No. - But bad-tasting food might\nnot be all the airlines' fault. See, the air that's pumped\ninto the cabin altitude is really dry. And the Sahara Desert for reference has an average relative humidity of 25%, but inside an airplane cabin,\nit can be as low as 5%. This can dry out your nasal passages, hindering your sense of\nsmell and therefore taste. The lower cabin pressure\ncan also decrease sensations like the intensity of salt and sugar. But there is one flavor\nthat appears to be enhanced in flight. What do you drink in an airplane? What's your drink of choice? - Apple juice. - Apple juice? - Yeah. - Interesting. - I mean Coke, that's default - Orange or apple juice. - Gin and tonic. - Maybe a Bloody Mary, but... - You're the first one today. - Really? - Yeah. A German survey of a thousand flyers found that more than a quarter of them order tomato juice in flight. And what's really weird is\nthat 23% of those people would never drink it on the ground. And would you drink Bloody Mary, would that be like a\nstandard drink at the bar or is it a special plane drink? - I only have it on planes. - So, why is everyone\nordering tomato juice? Well, it could be because of the noise. A 2015 study points to the chorda tympani, a nerve that carries taste information from the tongue to the brainstem. It runs right past the eardrum, between the tiny sound conducting bones. So, loud cabin noise might\nunintentionally stimulate it. This could produce an audio illusion that boosts our sense of umami, the savory taste you\nfind in MSG, soy sauce, and well, tomatoes. - I always drink tomato\njuice and I never knew why. It just felt like my plane drink. Or like spicy tomato juice- - Yeah. - Like both of those\nare favorites of mine. - Yeah. So, next time you're on a flight, go for something extra sweet or salty or maybe try the tomato juice. I feel like with how much people fly, our perspective of flying is still pretty distorted. So, why is that? - Yeah. I know that we talk a lot\nabout accidents and incidents and we dig into them really, really deep and people might ask, \"Why\nwould you be doing this? Doesn't that just make people\neven more afraid of flying?\" But the fact is that this\nis one of the prime reasons why aviation is as safe as it is. The fact that we have\nhundreds of professionals that dig deep into these accidents means that we learn from them. So, every flight becomes\na little bit safer. That's actually a big reason that I started my channel\nMentour Pilot in the first place 'cause I promise you, the more you know the safer you'll feel. (closing music) - Do you think that climate\nchange increases turbulence? - Eh, depends on what people\nthink about their opinions. - Yeah. - It's been a bit of that in\nnews recently, hasn't there? - Today, the media tends to prioritize sensationalized headlines\nover key details. Part of why airplane mode is\nstill such a big deal today is because of the media frenzy\nit started in the 1960s. So it's more important than ever to look at all sides of the story. This is why we specifically\nasked Ground News to sponsor this video. Recent stories about the\nincrease in turbulence come from a 2023 study that suggested a link to climate change. Yet, this study was barely\nreported on by the media, totally eclipsed by other major events. But Ground News lets you\nsee the whole picture. You can easily compare the coverage and verify the source of the information. If you look closer, you'll see that some of the outlets, like The Independent and the SCMP, argue that climate change is\nmaking flying more dangerous. While others like the Free\nPress paint a different picture by dismissing the study. That's why it's really important to look at all the information. But Ground News doesn't\nonly highlight breaking news on things like science and aviation, they also specifically\nshow blind spot stories the media isn't covering. Veritasium is all about\ngetting to the truth and Ground News' mission is to provide all sides of every story, so that we can do that for ourselves.

    "content": "Is our food becoming less nutritious? Many people claim that the nutrient content in our food has been decreasing over the decades. But is this really true, and should we be worried? A study published in 2004 looked at 43 different common garden crops, and how their nutritional value had changed between 1950 and 1999. Now, what they found was that on average, the protein content of those plants decreased by about 6%, Vitamin C decreased 15%, and vitamin B2 by a whopping 38 percent. They also noticed declines and minerals like iron and calcium. Now, there is some debate around the numbers because, well, How well could we really have measured those nutrients back in 1950? But there is still this concern that the food we're eating today might be less nutritious than, say, the same vegetables 50 years ago. Several other recent studies also suggest a pattern is emerging. So if we're witnessing a nutrient collapse, what's causing it? One factor that many people point to is depletion of the soils. Given plants to draw their nutrients up from the soil, intense farming practices were thought to be the cause of nutrient depletion. If you look at micronutrients, things like minerals, well, there are decreasing levels in plants. But, farmers have always put a lot of effort into maintaining their soils, and using fertilizers to ensure that the plants have all the nutrients they need, which makes that argument less convincing. We're still getting big plants, and they wouldn't grow that well if they didn't have the nutrients they need in the soil. So why else might nutrients be declining? One possibility is that it's selective breeding. If you look at crops like corn today, they're barely recognizable when you compare them to their ancestors, the wild corn from which these were bred. Basically since the advent of agriculture, we have been breeding our food crops for higher yields, for resistance to pests and changes in the climate. And, by and large, we've been successful. Crops are now bigger and grow faster than ever before. But are they more nutritious? Maybe we've accidentally been breeding the nutrition out of our foods in pursuit of other objectives. It's tough to really assess how big of a factor selective breeding is, because we can't easily compare this produce to the same produce a hundred years ago or a thousand years ago. So we need something else to be able to determine whether it's selective breeding causing this decrease or something else. What would be really helpful would be a plant that has never been selectively bred. Where would you find one like that? Well, this is where weeds come in handy. In North America, there is a wild flower called goldenrod. It's an important source of protein for bees, but not humans. And so, it has remained wild, or untouched by selective breeding, but how would you know what goldenrod was like 100 or 200 years ago? The Smithsonian Institute have been keeping hundreds of samples of goldenrod dating all the way back to 1842. Using these samples and samples they collected in 2014, scientists were able to compare modern goldenrod with goldenrod from over a hundred years ago, and the results were astounding. They found that there was a 30% decrease in the amount of protein in the goldenrod pollen over that period. If it's not selective breeding, what else has contributed to goldenrod becoming less nutritious over the last 150 years or so? One rather surprising idea was that carbon dioxide could play a vital role. [Old time video]: Here we see in cross-section air with its particles of carbon dioxide gas enters the plant and makes its way into every living cell. CO2 is like plant food in the air. It basically increases the growth of all plants. Over the last couple of centuries, the level of CO2 in the atmosphere has increased a lot, from about 280 parts per million to over 400 parts per million today. Now, that might not sound like a lot, but if you're thinking of it as plant food, we're talking about an increase by almost 50%, and we can see the impact from space. It's called the greening of the planet. Scientists have been tracking the impact of CO2 on plants via experiments called FACE, which stands for Free Air Carbon dioxide Enrichment. Their experiments run by injecting more CO2 into the area where plant crops are grown, and they find that wheat, barley, rice and potatoes; they will grow faster if there's more CO2 in the atmosphere. But here's the thing. They don't necessarily become more nutritious, they simply put on more carbs. In other studies conducted in Japan and China, scientists pumped carbon dioxide into rice crops to simulate the kind of CO2 concentrations expected in 50 years time. On average, protein levels fell by 10 percent iron by 8 percent and zinc by 5 percent, But a lower concentration of nutrients doesn't necessarily correlate with a decline in the plant's nutrient contents. It's called the dilution effect. So what does all this mean for us? Well, by 2050 scientists estimate that up to a hundred and fifty million people in the developing world may be on the verge of protein deficiency, due to the decreasing levels of protein in their staple foods. So does that mean we should all be taking vitamins and supplements? Well, no. At least, not yet. Because the nutrient declines are small enough that you should still be able to get everything you need from a well balanced diet, Including plenty of fruits and veggies. But, the increasing levels of CO2 and the dilution effect may be exacerbating the obesity epidemic. The thinking goes like this: We feel full, or satiated, when we've consumed a certain amount of protein. So if the protein levels are going down We may have to eat more food, more carbohydrates, and more fats to achieve the same level of protein. And that may make us fatter. While this is still a contentious theory what is becoming increasingly clear is that the changing atmosphere, specifically the rising level of CO2, is changing the food we eat. Hey, I hope you enjoyed that. I made this video as kind of a companion piece to my new feature-length documentary called Vitamania, all about the sense and nonsense of vitamins and supplements. You can watch that documentary if you haven't already by clicking right here. It's available globally, except for France and Germany because it'll be on your TV on September 25th. I'm really sorry about that, but I really appreciate you making it possible for me to make both YouTube videos and Big international TV documentaries. It's been a lot of fun and really, I couldn't have done it without you."

    "content": "this will revolutionize education no prediction has been made as often or as incorrectly as that one in 1922 it was Thomas Edison who declared that the motion picture is destined to revolutionize our educational system and that in a few years it will supplant largely if not entirely the use of textbooks yeah and you know how that worked out by the 1930s it was radio the idea was you could beam experts directly into classrooms improving the quality of education for more students at lower cost and that would mean you require fewer skilled teachers a theme common to all of the proposed education revolutions like that of educational television in the 1950s and 60s studies were conducted to determine whether students preferred watching a lecture live or sitting in an adjacent room where the same lecture was broadcast via closed-circuit TV what would you prefer in the 80s there was no debating computers were the revolutionary solution to our educational woes they were audio-visual interactive and could be programmed to do almost anything you like well at the time they could run Oregon Trail but their potential was obvious researchers suspected that if they could teach kids to program say how to move a turtle around a screen then their procedural reasoning skills would also improve so how did it go well the students got better at programming the turtle but their reasoning skills were unaffected even by the 1990s we had not learned from the failure of our past predictions and I quote the use of video discs in classroom instruction is increasing every year and promises to revolutionize what will happen in the classroom of tomorrow video discs yeah those giant oversized CD things remember when they revolutionized education nowadays plenty of things are poised to revolutionize education like smart boards smartphones tablets and MOOCs those are massive open online courses and some believe we're getting close to a universal teaching machine a computer so quick and well programmed that is basically like having your own personal tutor in Sheen a student could work through well-structured lessons at their own pace receiving immediate and personally tailored feedback and all without the interference of a meddlesome and expensive teacher do these claims sound familiar over the past 100 years a lot of areas of life have been revolutionized but education is not one of them by and large students are still taught in groups by a single teacher and that is not what a revolution looks like some might blame this state of affairs on the inertia of our educational institutions it's just too hard to get a huge bureaucracy to change but I think the reason technology hasn't revolutionized education is something else something that goes to the very heart of what education is let's consider the process of learning say you want to teach someone how a human heart pumps blood which learning a do you think would be more effective this animation with narration or this set of static pictures with text obviously the animation is better I mean for one thing it shows exactly what the heart does for decades educational research focused on questions like this does a video promote learning better than a book our live lectures more effective than televised lectures is animation better than static graphics in all well-controlled studies the result is no significant difference that is so long as the content is equivalent between the two treatments the learning outcomes are the same with all different media how is this possible how can something which seems so powerful like animation be no more effective than static graphics well for one thing animations are fleeting and so you might miss something as they go by Plus since the parts are animated for you you don't have to mentally envision how the parts are moving and so you don't have to invest as much mental effort which would make it more memorable in fact sometimes esthetic graphics perform better than animations and I think this points to a really fundamental aspect of Education which is it doesn't matter what happens around the learner we are not limited by the experiences we can give to students what limits learning is what can happen inside this head that is where the important part of learning takes place no technology is inherently superior to any other researchers spent so much time investigating whether one medium or technology was more effective than another that they failed to investigate exactly how to use the technology to promote meaningful thought processes so the question really is what experiences promote the kind of thinking that is required for learning recently that research is being conducted and we're finding out some pretty important stuff I mean it may sound obvious but it turns out learning with words and pictures together whether they're animation & narration or static pictures and text works better than words alone also we see that anything which is extraneous needs to be eliminated from a lesson for example on-screen text competes with visuals so learners perform better when it is omitted than when it is present now that we know how best to make educational videos and any experience can be simulated in the video setting YouTube must be the platform that will revolutionize education I mean the number of educational videos on YouTube is increasing every day so why do we need teachers well if you think that the fundamental job of a teacher is to transmit information from their head to their students then you're right they are obsolete I mean you probably imagine a classroom where this teacher is spewing out facts at a pace which is appropriate for one student to fast for half and to slow for the rest luckily the fundamental role of a teacher is not to deliver information it is to guide the social process of learning the job of a teacher is to inspire to challenge to excite their students to want to learn yes they also do explain and demonstrate and show things but fundamentally that is beside the point the most important thing a teacher does is make every student feel like they are important to make them feel accountable for doing the work of learning all of this is not to say technology has had no impact on education students and teachers work and communicate via computers and videos are used both inside and outside of classrooms but all of this is best characterized as an evolution not a revolution the foundation of Education is still based on the social interaction between teachers and students for as transformative as each new technology seems to be like motion pictures or computers or smart boards what really matters is what happens inside the learners head and making a learner think seems best achieved in a social environment with other learners and a caring teacher [Music] [Music]"

Mmmmmmmm... yeah gas explosions Does it burn gas? - It burns gases?\n- It's burning air\n- Fire The fire that's on the sun But is the Sun really a giant ball of\nfire I mean wouldn't go out after five\nbillion years? This is one of the things that you just assume you know, but you don't actually know So in this bucket I have the components\nof the Sun Well, I have protons and neutrons There's some electrons but I didn't\nbring them Most of the Sun is actually protons\n- OK So what the protons does in the Sun\n- It's dance together yeah Okay okay\nLike this When they come close, you know what they do? They just ...\n- Colide\nActually they bounce off each other I'm coming in...\n- UOOOOOOH Why the protons bounce off each other?\n- Something about the electrons .... Positive and negative eletrons? Cause they don't like each other\n- They don't like each other That's because a proton needs a neutron, right? You know why they... they repel like that? -Magnetic force? The repelling magnetic type thing? Magnetic field, uh? -Electric field. Positives and negatives. Positive and Negative It's to do with the positive negative, right? We got protons, protons are? *Positive* -They're positively charged -Yeah so the positives repel each other, ok? This is why its so important that the sun's hot Cause if the sun is hot enough it gets these things moving so fast, that sometimes they can't avoid a collision -ok -And when they get too close they actually go *Pshh* *Pshh* *Pshh* *Pshh* -Smash the protons\n-Positive? -Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\nNo, no, no, sma... ahhh and now they're stuck together and you saw what happened when they smashed together What happened?\n-They Leaked\n-They Leaked *Pshh*\nis that energy? -Yeah\n-Sick Well the water poured out, but I guess energy would have poured out then. -The energy came out\n-The energy came out! what was the energy before it was energy? -Kinetic energy?\n-Stored energy. So what's happening there? -It's releasing some mass... like lighting?\n-Yeah, yeah, and that mass is, uh? -It's converted as energy, yeah It was the mass of the proton\n-(Ahhh!) When the protons smashed together they got lighter! -Yeah, yeah, yeah And they lost that mass and the mass was converted energy -Yeah, yeah\n-You know the famous equation about that? -(E = mc^2)\n-Yeah! E = mc^2? ?????\n(French) have your the famous\nequation -which? process proton makes energy? Well.. Ha ha ha ha E = mc^2 squared? Yes? So what's E? The Sun, I don't know, ha ha ha -E, E is energy, um m is *mass* C is..\n-Cassidy Kelvin? I don't remembers what C means... So c is... The speed of light -Speed of light? no, right? really\n-Yeah -Oh, I thought it was something different\n-Isn't that weird? The speed of light. (Right, Ahh) (Wow, no wonder we jumped science) it seems most people have a tough time\nremembering that C is for the speed of light maybe that's because C is a bit of\na strange letter to represent a speed in fact in Einstein's original paper he used the letter V for velocity of light but nowadays\neveryone uses the letter C for constant it's a constant of the\nuniverse the speed of light though some people claim the letter C\nstands for celeritas the Latin word for swiftness What is\nthat equation telling us about energy and mass? Energy equals constant mass? The mass and the energy... combine together, create the energy Ha ha ha ha it's basically saying like this mass that comes out\n-yeah gets converted to a lot of energy And the speed of light is a huge number -Yeah\n-If you think about that, a tiny bit of mass is a huge amount of energy so every second the Sun is actually\nlosing 4.3 billion kilograms every second\n-every second? -That amount of mass is being converted into -energy In the Sun hydrogen fuses together to form helium but, that's a little confusing because how out of only protons do we create a\nhelium nucleus which has two protons and two neutrons well the thing is when the first two smash together one up the protons\nactually emits a positron and a neutrino and quickly becomes a neutron next thing\nthat happens is another proton smashes in\n*Pshh* and again we get more energy released now if two particles like this collide *Pshh*\nthey emit two protons and what we're left with is a helium 4 nucleus there you have hydrogen fused into helium and a lot of mass lost, a lot of energy hehehe if you wanna know more about fusion in\nthe Sun check out this video by minute physics it explains how the protons can fuse\neven though they're not really going fast enough to overcome their repulsion (...for fusion will fuse together anyway) (and the Sun is so big it has so much\nhydrogen that these small chances happen all the time)"

    "content": "As an Australian Canadian the Fahrenheit temperature scale has\nalways seemed a bit arbitrary to me. I mean why does water\nfreezes at 32 degrees? Why that integer and what exactly does 0 represent? According to many sources the Fahrenheit scale was\ndefined by setting 0 degrees equal to the temperature of\nthe ice salt and water mixture And a hundred degrees being\nroughly equal to human body temperature. But that isn't true. The real story is much more\ninteresting and scientific. August 14th, 1701 was\nalmost certainly the worst day in the life of 15 year-old\nDaniel Gabriel Fahrenheit. On that day, both of his parents\ndied suddenly from mushroom poisoning. And he was sent from Poland\nwhere he lived to Amsterdam to become\nan apprentice bookkeeper. But Fahrenheit couldn't\nstand his apprenticeship and ran away so many times that his employer\nput out a warrant for his arrest. Traveling from city to city around Europe, he became fascinated with\nscientific instruments and in particular, thermometers. In 1708, possibly seeking help\nwith the warrant, Fahrenheit met with\nthe mayor of Copenhagen, who happened to be\nthe famous astronomer Ole Rømer. Rømer is known for observing\nthe eclipses of Jupiter's moons and realizing that variations\nin the timing of those eclipses was caused by the time\nit took light to reach Earth. In other words, he found a way to accurately measure\nthe finite speed of light. But, more pertinent to this story, in 1702, Rømer was housebound\nafter breaking his leg. And to pass the time, he devised a\nbrand-new temperature scale with the freezing point of water\nat 7.5 degrees and body temperature at 22.5 degrees. Now, this might seem odd\nuntil you consider that Rømer wanted the boiling point of\nwater to be 60 degrees. As an astronomer, he had\nexperience dividing things by 60. So if you take this scale, divide it in half, in half again\nand in half once more, you find the freezing point of water\none eighth up the scale, and human body temperature\nthree eighth up the scale. So at their meeting in 1708 Fahrenheit learned of Rømer's temperature\nscale and adopted it as his own, adjusting it slightly because he found it \"inconvenient and inelegant on\naccount of fractional numbers\". So he scaled them up to 8 and 24. And this is the original Fahrenheit scale. He produced thermometers\nfor some time using this scale. But then at some later point, Fahrenheit multiplied all numbers\non the scale by 4 setting freezing point to the now-familiar\n32 and body temperature to 96. It's unclear exactly why he did this. He may just have wanted\nfiner precision in his measurements. But I think there was a better reason. You see, Fahrenheit was an\nexcellent instrument maker. His thermometers agreed\nwith each other precisely at a time when that was unheard of. He pioneered the use of mercury\nas a measuring liquid, which has the benefit of a much higher\nboiling point than the alcohol used in most other\nthermometers at the time. And for these accomplishments he was inducted into\nthe British Royal Society. And we know that he read\nthe works of Newton, Boyle, and Hook, in which he would have come across the idea that one degree increase in\ntemperature could correspond to a specific fractional increase in\nthe volume of the measuring liquid. And today, a one degree Fahrenheit\nincrease in temperature increases the volume of\nmercury by exactly one part in 10,000. Is this just a coincidence? Well, we'll probably never know\nfor sure because as an instrument maker Fahrenheit\nwas very secretive about his methods. But I think the data strongly\nsuggest that this was the case. So, what exactly did zero represent on\nthe scales of Fahrenheit, and Rømer? By many accounts, it's the temperature of\nsalt ice and water mixture. The only problem is there are different\ndescriptions of these mixtures And none of them actually produces\nthe temperature they're supposed to. More likely, I think they picked the\ncoldest temperature in winter set that as zero and later used ice and brine to\ncalibrate new thermometers. In his day, the Fahrenheit thermometer\nwas the best you could get. But now his scale is only\nused regularly in the Cayman Islands, Bahamas, Belize— oh, and\nthe United States of America. So maybe it's time we all\nadopted the global scale of temperature: Celsius, which by the way,\nwasn't invented by Celsius at all. Hey! So that was something\na little bit different. This video was animated by Marcello Ascani. I've got a link to his channel in\nthe description. You know, I became really fascinated\nwith temperature scale after I saw the original\nCelsius thermometer. You can see that video here.

    "content": "- On December 1st, 2022, the journal \"Nature\"\npublished a cover story about a holographic wormhole. It was purportedly created\ninside a quantum computer to probe the intersection of\nquantum mechanics and gravity. The story kicked off a frenzy\nof tweets and news headlines. - Nobody has seen the wormhole. Nobody has produced one. - Well, we'll\ntake the world's best quantum computer and\nsee if we can map that into building the wormhole. - The wormhole becomes\ntraversable, it opens. You really can go through. - Bull (beep).\n(host laughing) (magnets clicking) - This video is sponsored by Shopify. The problem was, of course, that no wormhole had been created. - It feeds on itself, right? When one story starts, then other media outlets grab hold of it and so it spreads very, very quickly. - What actually happened is that a super, a quantum computer is built and within this quantum computer, you can do some calculations. Calculations that can\nbe done with my iPhone because all the most powerful\nquantum computers today, at most do calculations that can easily be done on my iPhone. - You basically have something that represents the\nmathematics of a wormhole. But the way the story was sold, of course, is that in doing this,\nwhatever calculation they did, they had created the wormhole. - They say so in the same\nsense in which I could say, \"Look, my children has built a rocket \"that goes to the moon.\" Say, \"Wow, what kind of child you have? \"Yeah, here it is.\" And I show you a little\nsketch on a piece of paper when there is a drawing of\na rocket going to the moon and say, \"Look!\" So what the quantum computer\nhas done is exactly that. There's a little sketch of what\ncould be perhaps a warm hole in some hypothetical theory,\nwhich is probably wrong. Is this interesting? Yes, it is interesting because the fact that\nwith quantum computers you can do these things\nmean that quantum computers, a little bit, sort of begin working. So people get excited about\nthat and then they go out and tell to the world, \"Oh,\nwe've created a wormhole \"in a quantum computer,\" over overemphasizing the wormhole, which probably don't exist,\nthe theory being used of that, which probably is wrong, and the utility of quantum computers, which is not yet there. So that's an example of bad communication, very bad communication. I was embarrassed, I was angry with my\ncolleagues who did that. - To me, it looks like the source of this problem is bad incentives. Scientists need to secure\nfunding for their research and increasingly that depends on attracting public attention to their work. - It's just become part\nof the culture of science, that it's expected that you will have some sort of media attention and to get that attention,\nyou have to sell your science and often it's not the\nresult of the science that is the story, it's something else. - Universities seek to promote themselves to attract students and\nbolster their reputations. - And nowhere in the scientific method is, and you release a press release, but it's just become part of the norm now. - Press releases simplify and\nmay overstate the research and journalists just want to get as many clicks on their\nstories as they can. The end result of this incentivized game of telephone can be oversimplified sensationalized headlines,\nscience that is just plain wrong. Now, I myself have been guilty of over-hyping a science story. Back in 2014, I made a video\nabout the bicep two experiment. So this is one of the hugest discoveries in science of all time. Researchers reportedly\ndetected polarization in the cosmic microwave\nbackground radiation. Allegedly it was caused by\ngravitational fluctuations just a fraction of a\nsecond after the big bang. The result was considered\nthe first real evidence of the quantum nature of gravity and a smoking gun for inflation theory. Experimenters even surprised Andre Lind, one of the founders of\ninflation theory with the news. - Let's just hope that it is not a trick. I always leave with this feeling, what if I'm tricked? What if I believe in this\njust because it is beautiful? - Unfortunately, further\nobservations showed that it was likely just\ndust in our own galaxy rather than primordial gravitational waves that created the polarization in the CMB. So I took down my video and to this day I am\nwary about making videos about breaking science news. Like any type of breaking news,\nthere is a high probability that early reports will\nturn out to be wrong. Just a few months ago,\na paper was uploaded to the Archive Pre-print Server claiming to have discovered\nthe first room temperature ambient pressure superconductor. This again triggered a\nflood of media attention. - [Reporter] A monumental breakthrough, room temperature superconductor LK99. - One of the most important scientific breakthroughs of the 21st century. - If the discovery were real,\nit would've been a big deal. - The room temperature\nsuperconductor stuff, of course, is such a\ndream 'cause if it worked, it would revolutionize everything, right? Transmission of energy,\nthat kind of stuff. The world would be different if it worked. - But even before attempts\nto replicate the material and its properties failed, there were clear signs\nthat the claim was false. In the only published\nplot showing resistivity versus temperature, the\nresistivity did not drop to zero as you'd expect at the\nsupposed critical temperature. Instead, it continued to\ndecrease below this value. Plus the resistivity\nscale was given in units of 10 to the minus two ohm centimeters. On that scale, any ordinary conductor would appear to have zero resistivity. Copper's resistivity, for example, is on the order of 10 to the\nminus six ohm centimeters. A video showed the material\napparently levitating above a permanent magnet\nin a supposed demonstration of the Meisner effect. But in that same video, the material also sticks to the magnet, something a superconductor would not do. And finally there is this plot, showing that over the\npast a hundred years, scientists have found new materials with progressively higher\ncritical temperatures. But as of now, all the\nhighest temperature materials only super conduct at very high pressures. For an ambient pressure room\ntemperature superconductor, we would need a jump\nin critical temperature of around 125 degrees Celsius. That's a lot and this brings up the point that it is the most unexpected\nand surprising results that get the most attention, but it is also these very same results that are the most likely to be false. In social science, it's\nbeen shown that studies that later fail to be replicated, receive on average 153 more citations than studies that can be replicated. Similar buzz surrounds faulty research in the physical sciences. - The Italians, I'm Italian, came out announcing into\nthe world some time ago that the neutrino was faster than light and then measured it and\nit turned out to be a plug that was not fitting well and so the entire machine\nwas not working well. - When the truth is discovered, it rarely gets as much attention\nas the original finding. - The fallout where everybody was going, \"Oh, well this doesn't work\nand this doesn't look right \"and there's no way this material can do \"what they say it's doing.\" That sort of fizzles in the background, it doesn't get the same media attention. - There is the apt saying, \"A lie can travel around the world \"while the truth is still\nputting on its shoes.\" But that saying might need to be updated in the age of social\nmedia when lies now have an even greater advantage. Do you think it's a bigger\nproblem now than it used to be? - I must admit that I\nthink it's getting worse. I think there's a feeling that you've got to change the world to be noticed by the media. - Over-hyping science\ndiscoveries can give people a false sense of how science works. If that latest discovery I hear\nabout turns out to be false, what else could be untrue? - People keep telling me\nthat cosmology's in crisis and all this kind of stuff\nbecause that's the kind of stories they hear in the media. Eventually people will say, \"Well, why are we funding these things \"if it's always just turmoil?\" - Making bold unsubstantiated claims also reduces trust in scientists. - So we are enlarging a little bit. The conversation here is not\njust single pieces of news. I think there are entire\nfields which are hyped. - Wait, entire fields of science that are- - Yes.\n- Hyped. - Yes. - But aren't really legit or just they're all hot air or... - Oh no, no, they're not hot air. - [Host] Fusion, fusion's big in the news. People think it's close, right? There's startups, there's people getting\nbillions of dollars. - Exactly, I don't know\nwhere we are there. Again, it's not my field, but there was one particular announcement, what is it? One year ago or something. - [Host] I remember this announcement. - Scientists have produced\na nuclear fusion reaction that created more energy\nthan was expended, a breakthrough to tap into\nthe same kind of energy that powers the sun and the stars. - Simply put, this is one of the most impressive scientific\nfeats of the 21st century. (audience applauding)\nRight? (audience applauding) - Which is bull (beep) again because it was in the\ncontext of military research, nuclear energy, basically for\nweapons in a way of doing it, which at the present, has no visible way of how to become industrial\nway of producing energy. - [Host] Yeah, there's no way to scale. - There's no way to scale it up. - [Host] This is just lasers at appellate. - Just little thing and\nyou compress it enormously and then it's basically it explodes because it's a mini,\nmini nuclear explosion and then you have more energy than the actual pressure energy that was needed to compress it. That's correct, but you\nneed huge amount of, excessive energy for doing that. That was sold as a big step\ntoward the solving the energetic problem of the world, but it's not. - Back in '87, fusion, already people were talking about it like it's around the corner. We just need 20 years more\nwork and we'll crack it. And we have exactly the same story today with the current experiments. - Something that is not overhyped is this video sponsor, Shopify. And I would know, because I've been personally using Shopify for eight years. You know something a lot of\npeople don't know about me is that before I was a YouTuber, I worked as a science\nteacher at a tutoring company in Sydney. But I was always frustrated\nby this misconception students had that bonds\nstore energy, they don't. So I decided to make a better version of the traditional ball and\nstick model of molecules. One where the atoms snapped\ntogether magnetically. I came across these little ball magnets and in my first prototype I pushed them inside little styrofoam\nballs and I learned about plastics and injection\nmolding, ultrasonic welding, and I brought my\ninvention Snatoms to life. (magnets clicking) But one thing I had no clue about was how to run an online store and that's where Shopify came in. They had simple templates. So I set up the Snatoms\nstore in just one day. Shopify allowed me to process payments, withhold appropriate state taxes and see everything that was happening with my store at a glance. Plus, it also integrates with lots of third party apps and sites. So, for example, I could offer\nmultiple different methods of shipping and this\nmakes fulfillment a snap. (magnet clicking) I also got set up for Google shopping right from within the app and it was simple to create\nautomated reminder emails like if someone forgets\nsomething in their cart. The whole store runs with\nvery little attention from me, which is great because I'm\nalways working on the next video. So I think there is a reason\nthat everyone is using Shopify for their online store\nor their side hustle, because it offers\neverything you could want, it's easy to use and it's very affordable. I highly recommend Shopify to anyone who's thinking about starting a business and for a free trial of Shopify, go to shopify.com/veritasium. And now back to science hype. Science is interesting in\nthat you can divide it up into basically two categories. One is an established body of knowledge and the other is speculations,\nthings that might be true, but we don't really have any\nsolid evidence for them yet. And because there can be\nan infinity of bad ideas and only one truth, most of these speculations\nare likely wrong. But the way certain topics\nare discussed in the media, it may be impossible to tell if they're part of the\nestablished body of knowledge or just very fanciful speculation. - There are too many\nbooks out there saying, \"We have understood that the world's \"made by strings and string theory.\" It's not true, not at all. We have not understood that the world is described as string theory. We have a very interesting\ntentative theory, which is string theory,\nwhich has that some success and some failures and that's interesting. If you want to tell about this research, do tell about this research, but don't tell people that it's what we have learned about the world. - One question I have is, how do we get past the\nover-hyping of science? Because it seems like the system is set up to reward over-hyping. It rewards the journalists\n'cause they get the clicks. It rewards the scientists, they may get the money or the attention. So I don't know, I'm kind of curious whether a solution is possible. - Yeah, I think there is one, and it's exactly what you're doing. By talking about the fact that there is a risk of overhyping. If I can go out and say, \"Oh, my quantum computer\nproduced a wormhole,\" and nobody says anything,\nthat's a problem. If we talk about the risk of over-hyping, if we talk about the\nrisk of presenting ideas, theories, radical results, which are very, very tentative, as solid, then we sort of immunize\nourself against this danger. - Science is not presented on the news like sport is presented on the news. At the end of the news, you\nget 10 minutes of sports where they will talk about the fact that somebody kicked a\nball around in a field and it's not that particularly important. So you get the full rundown of lots of bits and\npieces of what's going on. But to get a science story, it has to be Earth\nshattering kind of thing. It has to be a big story. What many scientists would\nlike is this larger picture of the fact that the entire\nenterprise is moving forward. That there are lots of things happening and we definitely know more\ntomorrow than we do today, but that's not the way that it\ngets picked up by the media. - Well, ultimately, almost\neveryone is incentivized to sensationalize scientific findings. So I think it's important to remember that anytime you hear a\nscience story on the news, surprising, unexpected results that have not been\nindependently replicated, they are more likely than not to be wrong. But despite this, I remain\nconvinced that science is the best way to get at the truth. I mean, sure, in the short term, some may seek the spotlight by rushing the data analysis, overstating results or\ncircumventing peer review. but in the long term, that is not going to\nwin you the Nobel Prize. The bold claims, mistakes and dead ends, they will fade into oblivion and only sound science\nthat is vigorously tested and independently validated, that is what makes it into the\naccepted body of knowledge.

    "content": "Is there water on the Moon The obvious answer seems to be No.\nbecause during a day on the Moon, which lasts 2 earth weeks, the temperature on the lunar surface gets up to 123 degrees celsius, which would be enough to boil away any water if the Moon had an atmosphere like Earth, which it doesn't. And the reason that it doesn't is because the Moon's gravity is weak, just a sixth of Earth's gravity, which means it can't hold onto light fast moving molecules like water. Anything going faster than 2.4 kilometers per second the Moon's escape velocity is gone. But that might sound pretty quick, but at any given temperature there are always a small number of molecules going significantly faster than the average. On the Moon these molecules flap into space and then other molecules take their place until all the light fast moving molecules are gone. Plus, since the Moon has a very weak magnetic field, there's little to protect the lunar surface from the solar wind. That's the stream of charged particles coming from the Sun. These particles can effectively blast molecules from the surface of the Moon into space. In fact that's how Mars lost most of its atmosphere. So in short, if the Moon ever had any water, it should be long gone by now. And this appeared to be confirmed by the Moon landings. Rock samples brought back by Apollo astronauts contained virtually no hydrated minerals. Some water was detected but it was assumed just to be terrestrial contamination rather than actual Moon water, because seals on some of the sample-return containers were damaged by the gritty moondust. But in 2009 a very different picture emerged, when scientists intentionally crashed part of a rocket into the surface of the Moon. It was going two point five kilometers per second on impact, making a crater 25 meters wide and 4 meters deep. That injected 10,000 tons of material with half of it making high enough to be lit by the Sun. That allowed cameras on an orbiting spacecraft, to look for the emission lines of water in the dust. And what did they find ? The water emission lines were bright. Scientists estimated that five point six percent the mass of the objective debris was water. but how is this possible? Where did the water come from and hadn't remain on the Moon? Well strangely enough, there are actually three different sources of lunar water. To understand the first source, you just have to look at where they crashed that rocket into theMmoon. Now it's a misconception that the Moon has a dark side. Although the same side always faces earth, all sides of the Moon do receive sunlight. However, at the poles there are some craters which due to their location and depth, are always in shade. They're called but permanently shadowed regions. Now since they never see the Sun, these craters are some of the coldest places in the whole solar system, colder than the surface of Pluto. They can reach negative 249 celcius. And it is here that scientists decided to crash that piece of rocket. Since the permanently shadowed regions maintain such a consistently low temperature, they act as cold traps places where volatiles like water remained frozen as ice. But, where the water come from in the first place? Well, from water containing comets and asteroids that have struck the Moon over time. Any water molecules that found their way to the permanently shadowed regions would be trapped there. Forever. as ice but this is not the only source of water on the Moon. In a lunar samples from Apollo 15 and 17, scientists found tiny glass beads.\nThese beads were formed back when the Moon was still volcanically active. Fire fountains launch droplets of lava into space, where they cooled rapidly and then fell back to the surface. In 2007 these beads were sliced in half and tested for water. The results showed significant amount of water with concentrations highest in the middle of the beads, and this indicates that the water must have been trapped there during the initial eruption, rather than leaching in due to contamination once those beads were back on earth. Now, this water came from the interior of the Moon. So the Moon must have contained water to begin with, which kind of makes sense considering the Moon is likely a piece of Earth that broke off billions of years ago in an impact with a mars-sized body. The third and final source of water on the Moon is : Water created on the Moon surface from the reaction of oxygen and hydrogen. Now, the source of oxygen is easy. Oxygen makes up 45 percent of the lunar surface mostly bounded oxide mineral. But where do you get the free hydrogen? The answer is in the solar wind, which is constantly bombarding the Moon surface with protons. These can react with oxygen, to form hydroxide, and ultimately water. This water can then drift over the surface of the Moon until either flys off into space, or it lands in the cold traps and becomes ice. So there is water on the Moon. And this is important because it means that future missions can take advantage of this valuable resource. Not only for Moon colonists to drink and grow crops, but also for processing into rocket fuel. If you can make your own rocket fuel on the Moon, that dramatically reduces the challenges and cost of space travel. For a long time we used to think the Moon was completely dry. But now we know that hypothesis is all wet. Big news! I have a brand new channel called Sciencium, posting videos in this format.

    "content": "Have you ever made ice cubes and then found\nthat when you take them out of the freezer there are spikes on them? This phenomenon has caused a lot of curiosity\nand some concern. The truth is, there is a simple physical process\nresponsible for ice cube spikes. Ice cubs cool first from their top surface\nwhere they are in direct contact with the cold freezer air and from which evaporative\ncooling can occur. So the first ice crystals form on the surface\nof the ice cube and along its edges. Now as that ice freezes, it expands by roughly\neight percent. That is due to hydrogen bonding between the\nwater molecules which makes them on average slightly further apart than they are in water. So as the ice grows in from all sides, the\nwater in the middle has nowhere to go. And it is forced up and out through a hole\nin the ice. These holes are often triangular in shape\nbecause ice crystals tend to meet at 60 degree angles. As the water comes up through the hole it\nfreezes around the edges forming a hollow spike. And as the ice continues to grow, more water\nis forced up the spike, making it longer. This continues until all of the water is frozen,\nor until the end of the spike freezes shut. If you want to make ice cube spikes, they\ncan be created in most ordinary freezers and there are three steps you can take to increase\nyour chances. Number one, the ideal temperature seems to\nbe not too cold, between minus five and minus eight Celsius. That is cold enough to freeze the water, but\nnot so quickly as to freeze off the tip of that ice cube spike. Number two, distilled water seems to work\nbetter than tap water because even small concentrations of salt prevent spike formation. Number three, a fan in the freezer seems to\nhelp spike formation by increasing the circulation of the air and increasing evaporative cooling. And given just the right conditions, very\nlarge ice spikes can form, for example, on bird baths. In these cases the spikes are known as ice\nvases, for obvious reasons. When looking at this structures, it is interesting\nto contemplate that they only form because of water’s unique property of expanding\nwhen it freezes. If water didn’t expand when it froze, the\nwhole earth would be dramatically different, because, well, since ice is less dense, it\nforms on the surface and actually insulates the water underneath, so it remains liquid\nand allows life to survive in it. But if, instead, ice were denser than water,\nit would sink to the bottom allowing for further cooling of that water and more ice formation. And the ice would build up from the bottom\nupwards, giving less and less water for organisms to live in, until, if cold conditions persisted\nfor long enough, all bodies of water would completely solidify as ice, meaning that virtually\nno life could live in them. And at that point, the earth would also be\ncompletely white. So it would reflect more of the sun’s light\ninto space, leading to further cooling. So if water didn’t expand when it froze,\nthe whole earth would be a cold, lifeless snowball. But it all depends on your starting conditions,\nbecause if there wasn’t very much ice on the earth to begin with, it would all sink\nto the bottom of bodies of water, including arctic sea ice and that means the earth’s\nsurface would be less reflective, so it would absorb more heat from the sun and it would\nget a lot warmer. So if ice didn’t float, if ice was denser\nthan water, either the earth would be much colder than it is now or much hotter than\nit is now. And in either case, life on earth might not\nexist. But if it did, we wouldn’t be able to make\nice cube spikes."

You have to make some\nsimplifying assumptions about this circuit, like the wires have to have no resistance, otherwise this wouldn't work and the light bulb has\nto turn on immediately when current passes through it. But I want you to commit to an answer and put it down in the comments so you can't say, oh yeah I knew that was the answer, when I tell you the answer later on. This question actually relates\nto how electrical energy get from a power plant to your home. Unlike a battery, the electricity in the grid comes in the form of\nalternating current, or AC, which means electrons in the power lines are just wiggling back and forth. They never actually go anywhere. So, if the charges don't\ncome from the power plant to your home, how does the electrical\nenergy actually reach you? When I used to teach this subject, I would say that power lines are like this flexible plastic tubing and the electrons inside\nare like this chain. So, what a power station does, is it pushes and pulls the\nelectrons back and forth 60 times a second. Now, at your house, you can plug in a device, like a toaster, which essentially means allowing the electrons to run through it. So when the power station\npushes and pulls the electrons, well, they encounter resistance\nin the toaster element, and they dissipate their energy as heat, and so you can toast your bread. Now, this is a great story, I think it's easy to visualize, and I think my students understood it. The only problem is, it's wrong. For one thing, there is no continuous conducting wire that runs all the way from a\npower station to your house. No, there are physical gaps, there are breaks in the line, like in transformers where one coil of wire\nis wrapped on one side, a different coil of wire is\nwrapped on the other side. So, electrons cannot possibly flow from one the other. Plus, if it's the electrons that are carrying the energy from the power station to your device, then when those same electrons flow back to the power station, why are they not also carrying energy back from your house to the power station? If the flow of current is two ways, then why does energy only\nflow in one direction? These are the lies you were\ntaught about electricity, that electrons themselves\nhave potential energy, that they are pushed or pulled through a continuous conducting loop and that they dissipate\ntheir energy in the device. My claim in this video is that all of that is false. So, how does it actually work? In the 1860's and 70's, there was a huge breakthrough in our understanding of the universe when Scottish physicist,\nJames Clerk Maxwell, realized that light is made up of oscillating electric\nand magnetic fields. The fields are oscillating\nperpendicular to each other and they are in phase, meaning when one is at its maximum, so is the other wave. Now, he works out the equations that govern the behavior of\nelectric and magnetic fields and hence, these waves, those are now called Maxwell's equations. But in 1883, one of Maxwell's former\nstudents, John Henry Poynting, is thinking about conversation of energy. If energy is conserved locally\nin every tiny bit of space, well, then you should be\nable to trace the path that energy flows from\none place to another. So, think about the energy\nthat comes to us from the sun, during those eight minutes\nwhen the light is traveling, the energy is stored and being transmitted in the electric and magnetic\nfields of the light. Now, Poynting works out an equation to describe energy flux, that is, how much electromagnetic energy is passing through an area per second. This is known as the Poynting vector and it's given the symbol S. And the formula is really pretty simple, it's just a constant one over mu naught, which is the permeability of free space times E X B. Now, E X B, is the cross product of the electric and magnetic fields. Now, the cross product\nis just a particular way of multiplying two vectors together, where you multiply their\nperpendicular magnitudes and to find the direction, you put your fingers in the\ndirection of the first vector, which in this case is the electric field, and curl them in the direction\nof the second vector, the magnetic fields, then your thumb points in the direction of the resulting vector, the energy flux. So, what this shows us about light is that the energy is\nflowing perpendicular to both the electronic\nan the magnetic fields. And it's in the same direction\nas the light is traveling, so this makes a lot of sense. Light carries energy from its source out to its destination. But the kicker is this, Poynting's equation doesn't\njust work for light, it works anytime there are electric and magnetic fields coinciding. Anytime you have electric\nand magnetic fields together, there is a flow of energy and you can calculate\nusing Poynting's vector. To illustrate this, let's consider a simple circuit with a battery and a light bulb. The battery by itself\nhas an electric field but since no charges are moving, there is no magnetic field so the battery doesn't lose energy. When the battery is\nconnected into the circuit, its electric field extends\nthrough the circuit at the speed of light. This electric field\npushes electrons around so they accumulate on some of\nthe surfaces of the conductors making them negatively charged, and are depleted elsewhere leaving their surfaces positively charged. These surface charges create a small electric\nfield inside the wires, causing electrons to drift preferentially in one direction. Note that this drift\nvelocity is extremely slow around a tenth of a millimeter per second. But this is current, well, conventional current is defined to flow opposite\nthe motion of electrons, but this is what's making it happen. The charge on the\nsurfaces of the conductors also creates an eclectic\nfield outside the wires and the current inside the wires creates a magnetic\nfield outside the wires. So, now there is a combination of electric and magnetic fields in this space around the circuit. So, according to Poynting's theory, energy should be flowing and we can work out the\ndirection of this energy flow using the right hand rule. Around the battery for example, the electric field is down and the magnetic field is into the screen. So, you find the energy\nflux is to the right away from the battery. In fact, all around the battery, you'll find the energy\nis radially outwards. Energy is going out through\nthe sides of the battery into the fields. Along the wires, again, you can use the right hand rule to find the energy is\nflowing to the right. This is true for the\nfields along the top wire and the bottom wire. But at the filament, the Poynting vector is directed\nin toward the light bulb. So, the light bulb is getting\nenergy from the field. If you do the cross product, you find the energy is coming\nin from all around the bulb. It takes many paths from\nthe battery to the bulb, but in all cases, the energy is transmitted by the electric and magnetic fields. - People seem to think that\nyou're pumping electrons and that you're buying\nelectrons or something, which is just so wrong. (laughs) For most people, and I think to this day,\nit's quite counterintuitive to think that the energy is\nflowing through the space around the conductor, but the energy is, which is traveling through the field, yeah, is going quite fast. - So, there are a few\nthings to notice here. Even though the electrons go two ways away from the battery and towards it, by using the Poynting vector, you find that the energy\nflux only goes one way from the battery to the bulb. This also shows it's the fields and not the electrons\nthat carry the energy. - How far do the electrons go in this little thing you're talking about, they barely move, they probably don't move at all. - Now, what happens if\nin place of a battery, we use an alternating current source? Well then, the direction of current reverses every half cycle. But this means that both the\nelectric and magnetic fields flip at the same time, so at any instant, the Poynting vector still\npoints in the same direction, from the source to the bulb. So the exact same analysis we used for DC still works for AC. And this explains how\nenergy is able to flow from power plants to home in power lines. Inside the wires, electrons just oscillate back and forth. Their motion is greatly exaggerated here. But they do not carry the energy. Outside the wires, oscillating eclectic and magnetic fields travel from the power\nstation to your home. You can use the Poynting vector to check that the energy flux is\ngoing in one direction. You might think this is\njust an academic discussion that you could see the\nenergy as transmitted either by fields or by\nthe current in the wire. But that is not the case, and people learned this the hard way when they started laying\nundersea telegraph cables. The first Trans Atlantic\ncable was laid in 1858. - It only worked for about a month, it never worked properly. - There are all kinds of distortions when they try to send signals. - Enormous amounts of distortion. They could work it at\na few words per minute. - What they found was sending signals over such a long distance under the sea, the pulses became\ndistorted and lengthened. It was hard to differentiate\ndots from dashes. To account for the failure, there was a debate among scientists. William Thomson, the future Lord Kelvin, thought electrical signals\nmoved through submarine cables like water flowing through a rubber tube. But others like Heaviside and Fitzgerald, argued it was the fields around the wires that carried the energy and information. And ultimately, this view proved correct. To insulate and protect\nthe submarine cable, the central copper conductor had been coated in an insulator and then encased in an iron sheath. The iron was only meant\nto strengthen the cable, but as a good conductor, it interfered with a propagation\nof electromagnetic fields because it increased the\ncapacitance of the line. This is why today, most power\nlines are suspended high up. Even the damp earth acts as a conductor, so you want a large insulating gap of air to separate the wires from the ground. So, what is the answer to our giant circuit light bulb question? Well, after I close the switch, the light bulb will turn\non almost instantaneously, in roughly 1/C seconds. So, the correct answer is D. I think a lot of people imagine that the electric field needs to travel from the battery, all the way down the wire which is a light second long, so it should take a second\nfor the bulb to light up. But what we've learned in this video is it's not really what's\nhappening in the wires that matters, it's what happens around the wires. And the electric and magnetic fields can propagate out through space to this light bulb, which is only one meter\naway in a few nanoseconds. And so, that is the limiting factor for the light bulb turning on. Now, the bulb won't receive the entire voltage of\nthe battery immediately, it'll be some fraction, which depends on the\nimpedance of these lines and the impedance of the bulb. Now, I asked several\nexperts about this question, and got kind of different answers, but we all agreed on these main points. So, I'm gonna put their\nanalysis in the description in case you want to learn more\nabout this particular setup. If I get called out on it and people don't think it's real, we can definitely invest the resources and string up some lines, and make our own power\nlines in the desert. - I think you're gonna\nget called out on it. - I agree, I think you're\ngonna get called out. (laughing) I think that's right. - I think it's just kinda wild that this is one of those things that we use everyday, that almost nobody thinks about or knows the right answer to. These traveling electromagnetic\nwaves around power lines are really what's delivering your power. Hey, now that you understand how electrical energy actually flows, you can think about that every time you flick on a light switch. And if you want to take your\nswitches to the next level, the sponsor of this\nvideo, Caseta by Lutron, provides premium smart lighting control, including switches, remotes,\nand plug-in smart dimmers. And since one switch can\ncontrol many regular bulbs, you can effectively make\nall those bulbs smart just by replacing the switch. Then, you can turn your lights on and off using your phone, or you can use another device like Alexa or Google Assistant. Caseta works with more\nleading smart home brands than any other smart\nlighting control system. One of the things I\nlike is setting timers. The lights in my office for example, turn on by themselves every evening. And this feature gives you peace of mind that everyone in your household will always come home to a well-lit house. And once you're already in bed, you can check which lights\nyou forgot to turn off and do that from your phone. Installation is easy. Make sure you turn off\npower to the switch first and then disconnect the existing wires and connect Caseda's smart switch. If you need any help, they're just a click or a call away. Learn more about Caseda\nat Lutron's website, lutron.com/veritasium. I will put that link\ndown in the description. So, I want to thank Lutron Electronics for sponsoring this video, and I want to thank you for watching."

    "content": "Climate justice now. Two words that we hear more and more.    Climate justice is linked to racial justice,\nsocial justice and intergenerational justice, too. This is why we call not only\nfor climate action, but climate justice. Two words that could define the century.    But what exactly does\nclimate change have to do with justice? Aren't we all in this together? To understand climate justice,\nwe need to understand climate injustice: who causes climate change and who's hurt by it. Let's first look at who's responsible for putting\ncarbon dioxide into the atmosphere and heating the planet. Imagine this grain of rice\nis one ton of carbon dioxide. Each year the average person in Nigeria\nadds less than one grain into the atmosphere. The average person in India two grains, in China seven grains, in Germany ten grains, in the US 17 grains. In one year, the average American\npollutes 20 times more than the average Nigerian.   But the problem with carbon is\nthat it stays trapped in the atmosphere for centuries. So it's not just about how much we add each year. It's about how much has piled up over time. Since 1850 that adds to about 1500 gigatons. Okay, we wanted to pour loads of these rice bags on the table to show you how big that really is but... after doing the math we realized we'd \nneed 3 million of them. Historical emissions matter today because countries are arguing about how soon they have to cut their net emissions down to zero. Big polluters like China, India and Brazil look \na lot less guilty when you consider they've only \nrecently become part of the problem. \"Thhe tendency is to quote the annual emissions. But that doesn't tell us anything \nabout why we're in the current mess.\" This is Prakash Kashwan, a political scientist researching climate justice. He says rich countries haven't accepted how unjust climate change really is. \"It's mind-boggling. The kind of inequalities\nthat have brought us to the current climate crisis, they're unbelievable\nand they aren't talked about enough.\" In 2020 researchers calculated how far each\ncountry is responsible for pushing CO2 levels beyond a safe threshold that we crossed in 1990. The study takes into account how \nmany people live in a country, how much they emitted throughout history and includes emissions that \ncross borders through traded goods. The research shows that rich countries\nhave outspent their carbon budgets — by a lot. The Global North has emitted 92% of the CO2 that pushed the planet beyond the safe levels. Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America have emitted just 8%. Even a massive emitter like China is only just using up its carbon budget now. But if you live in a country that runs on\nfossil fuels this doesn't mean climate \nchange is your fault personally. But some of your choices do still make a difference. Because it's not just about where you live, \nbut also how much you spend. The world's richest 1% emits twice as much as the poorest 50%. And those elites live all over the world. Unequal emissions are one big reason\nwhy climate activists are shouting about justice. \"Everyone already is affected by the climate crisis, just on a very different scale. But if we look at the people ruling Germany\nand sitting at the decision tables for the past decades, they have not faced their responsibility.\" \"They are destroying our environment. \nThey need to act now, not later.\" But hold up. CO2 heats the planet by the\nsame amount, whether it comes from Germany or Kenya: The climate doesn't care about geography. Well, geography cares about the climate. The second part of climate injustice is\nthat even though poorer countries have done the least to change the climate, \nthey're the ones getting hurt the most. Take heatwaves and drought. Heatwaves are becoming most unbearable\nacross Africa, where droughts are more punishing for crops. Then there's storms. Warmer air means that hurricanes \nand typhoons carry more energy and unleash more rain and stronger winds across the tropics. And by 2050, sea levels will have risen so high that floods which used to hit once a century  will strike many coastal cities every single year. You can check out one of our other videos to see how some cities are trying to keep themselves afloat. The inequalities of climate change come together hardest in a country like India. Even though its people have barely contributed to global warming they are \namong the most vulnerable. India's coastal cities are facing unprecedented floods \nwhile its rivers dry up, leaving farmers struggling \nto grow staples like rice and wheat. \"India is one of the most \ninequitable countries in the world. What we can see is even \nif you take a city like Mumbai - when floods happen in the city, \nit's the poor that are the most impacted.\" This is Payal Parekh, a climate scientist who campaigns full-time for justice. \"Having grown up in a country like India, I grew up with inequality all around me. And this is essentially what it comes down to: The world is very unequal and it's playing out in terms of climate change as well.\" But that inequality is found within rich countries too. Black and brown people in countries like the US or UK are typically poorer than white people. That means they have less money to spend on air conditioning to adapt to heatwaves or flood insurance to rebuild after storms. So how can we make it fairer? Well, polluting countries can \nfirst turn off the CO2 tap and start removing their \npollution from the atmosphere. Then they could pay reparations for\nusing up more than their  fair share of emissions. Some countries and companies are\nalready doing something similar by paying poor countries to not chop down forests and instead plant trees. But instead of using that saved carbon to atone for their climate debts, they're using \nit as an excuse to keep on emitting. \"Climate reparations have to be part of that discussion and climate debt in particular is where we divide up who is responsible for the kind of ecological changes and climate changes we're seeing in societies but also the climate-induced disasters that countries are facing.\" This is Keston Perry, a political economist studying climate justice. He says reparations are needed to balance the scales but that they won't be enough. \"It is an interim measure. When I say that I mean we have to have a much more longer-term conversation around the economic system that we have nurtured and cultivated globally that have resulted in these kinds of disasters. And what do we do to not only reform that system but absolutely overhaul it.\" Reparations might sound radical but rich countries already agreed to pay poorer ones to adapt to climate change. Imagine each of these peas is $1 billion. Rich countries promised 100 of them each year in climate finance by 2020. But it's 2021 and they haven't coughed up. In 2018 they gave 80 billion but \nmost of it was loans, not grants. UK-based charity Oxfam found the real aid was closer to 20 billion. \"Yearly we have not been meeting the kind of targets that even Global North countries have set themselves. That finance mechanism is not meant to actually solve the problem.\" Another approach takes climate \njustice more literally: holding polluters to account in court. After deadly wildfires tore through Portugal in 2017, six young activists took 33 industrial countries to the\nEuropean Court of Human Rights for failing to cut their emissions quickly. They argued that the countries are discriminating against young people who will have to live with the consequences of climate change. The verdict is still pending. In  Germany and the Netherlands, high court judges have ordered their governments to up their ambitions on cutting emissions.  Activists also won a case against Royal Dutch Shell, forcing the company to pay for oil pollution and are now demanding \nclimate-friendly investments too. \"The basic legal argument for assigning responsibility is your contribution to the problem – so how much do you emit, how much do you contribute to climate change, greenhouse gas emissions – and what is the possibility for contributing to the solution.\" The defendants argue \nthat national courts don't have the right to rule on the climate because emissions and their impacts are global. But a new generation of activists are fighting for them to take exactly that responsibility – and give them climate justice. People have no idea how injust the climate crisis is. And that's why we're making videos about it every Friday to help you understand. So if you like what you saw, then hit subscribe!"

    "content": "Climate change is one of humanity's most severe\nand urgent challenges. As can be expected from anything that has\na worldwide impact, climate change and global warming are often shrouded in controversy\nand competing narratives. With that in mind, let's begin by understanding\nwhat exactly climate change is and what makes it so dreadful for our planet. The term climate change is used to denote\nthe long-term changes in the weather patterns in a given region. Another term often interchanged with climate\nchange is global warming. Global warming is formally defined as a rise\nin Earth's temperature that persists for a decade or longer. There could be several causes for climate\nchange, but the biggest one is the rising concentration of greenhouse gases. Simply put, greenhouse gases are those gases\nin our atmosphere that trap heat. Some examples include carbon dioxide, methane,\nchlorofluorocarbons, nitrous oxide and ozone. How these gases affect climate change depends\non their amount and their global warming potential or GWP. This metric tells us how long a gas remains\nin the atmosphere, on average, and how strongly it absorbs energy. Naturally, gases with a higher GWP absorb\nmore heat, and thus contribute more to increasing Earth's overall temperature, or in other words,\nwarming it. Natural sources and human activities both\nresult in the emission of greenhouse gases. One of the most common ways these gases get\nreleased into the atmosphere is through the burning of fossil fuels. Burning coal or oil to run industrial processes\nor giant factories increases the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Indeed, fossil fuels' contribution to greenhouse\ngas emissions is the largest, in the range of 70- 80% of total emissions. Agriculture is another serious factor; greenhouse\ngas emissions from agriculture come from livestock, such as cows, agricultural soils, and rice\nproduction, and are in the range of 10-15% of all emissions. Clearing forests for cultivation, industry\nand other human activities also increases concentrations of greenhouse gases, especially\ncarbon dioxide. The share of changes in land use patterns\nrepresents 5-10% of all emissions. Carbon dioxide concentration is the highest\namong all greenhouse gases in the atmosphere; therefore, it is a significant contributor\nto global warming. Since the industrial revolution, a drastic\nincrease in economic activity has triggered a sharp uptick in carbon dioxide emissions\nworldwide. These emissions are higher than the amount\nthat can be captured by the earth’s natural carbon cycle. This is why rising carbon dioxide emission\nis a point of great concern to every nation on the planet. The rise in global temperature changes several\nother weather patterns and geographical conditions. For example, an increase in temperature directly\nimpacts the snow, river and lake ice, sea ice, glaciers, ice caps, ice shelves and ice\nsheets, as well as frozen ground, also known as permafrost. The rising surface temperature causes a decline\nin ice mass. Ice mass measurement by NASA's satellite shows\nthat the Antarctic and Greenland mass is declining at an unprecedented rate. Glaciers are also retreating almost everywhere,\nincluding the Alps, Himalayas, Andes, Rockies, Alaska, and Africa. Furthermore, oceans absorb almost 90% of the\nexcess heat from the surrounding air, making it warmer. Although most of the heat is absorbed in the\nsurface, as the rate of warming increases, the heat permeates to deeper waters and harms\nmarine ecosystems. Sea level rise is caused primarily by water\nfrom melting ice sheets and glaciers and the expansion of seawater as it warms. Satellite observations indicate that the sea\nheight is increasing rapidly and will continue to rise at an increasingly rapid pace. The rise in sea levels negatively affects\nthe populace of coastal areas. It also plays a role in flooding and leads\nto an increase in storms. Climate change also leads to changes in the\nfrequency, intensity, spatial extent, duration, and timing of weather and climate extremes. Some extreme weather events include floods,\ndroughts, hurricanes, and heat waves. Weather and climate extremes occur when the\nweather or climate metric is above or below a threshold value of the variable. Some of the changes in weather patterns include\nan increase in the number of warm days and nights, a decrease in cold days and nights,\nand an increase in the frequency and intensity of daily temperature extremes. As you can imagine, climate change or global\nwarming doesn't happen overnight; these changes occur over decades or even centuries. Thus, it stands to reason that it's impossible\nto either stop or completely reverse its effects in just a few weeks or months. However, as a community, we could do many\nthings to slow down global warming and eventually embrace ways to stop or reverse it. The first and most crucial aspect of recovery\nis awareness, namely understanding and spreading awareness about the risks associated with\nclimate change. On a personal level, we could look at our\ntransportation and power consumption habits. Since industrial and automobile emissions,\nalong with the consumption of electricity, which is primarily generated by burning fossil\nfuels, are the most significant reasons for increasing carbon dioxide concentrations in\nthe atmosphere, rethinking these consumption patterns would make a measurable dent in our\ncollective carbon emissions. Climate change is a real threat, but if we\nall come together, take a stand, and be more environmentally conscious in our decisions,\nwe can still save our beautiful blue planet."

    "content": "What makes me remember that day is the \ntime my Dad left me and my Mum and my siblings.   Nyombi Morris was 10 years old when his family's \nfarm was swamped by floods in Uganda. I saw it happening because we slept on the street for two days before coming to Kampala and when we came to Kampala everything has been a mess.  Nyombi's family became one of the thousands fleeing their homes each year because of the impact of the climate emergency. I used even to ask my Mum when are we   going back to our place, like why are we in Kampala? \nWhy are we here, like I don't have friends, I don't   have anything? And she used to ignore, try to \nplay it cool. Until one day she took me back to   the area and said this was where we used to stay, I know you don't remember but this is where I used to stay but we left due to floods.  The United Nations estimates that environmental disasters   caused by climate change are now forcing twice \nas many people from their homes than conflict or violence. Yet despite the impact on millions of \nlives, denial and lies about the issue continue to spread online. We know that in the last couple \nof years people who have espoused conspiratorial   views say about the World Economic Forum, about \nCovid, about vaccines have also embraced, quite   often, theories about climate change and climate \ndenial. So can the scientists get their message across? Understanding climate is complex, it's not straightforward physics. There are many, many things going on. And can a new generation tackle online distortions amid all the other challenges they're facing? I see apathy, which I don't think is necessarily because people don't   care it's because they don't have the time to be \nthinking about climate change when they don't have   the money to fuel their home or they don't have \nthe money to eat a balance meal. I’m Babita Sharma and this is The Documentary: Whose Truth? from the BBC World Service.  A series where we meet Nobel Prize laureates who are fighting conspiracy theories.  On this episode, the shifting sands of climate change disinformation. Can a new generation put science at the forefront in the battle to save the planet? I'm the daughter of a teacher. So I've always been really passionate about education and working with young people. For me, when I was in school, my climate education was a page in a textbook. And one of my friends in a GCSE science exam, for example, she had to write an essay about the benefits of climate change.  Phoebe L Hanson is on a mission to change the way climate change is taught in schools, even though she only left school herself in the last few years.  Because of the rules and guidance about impartiality, a lot of people have been teaching both sides of the argument, so to speak, on climate change. So pairing that accurate climate science with climate denial in the sake of balance and I see the same on social media, but I also see apathy. I see disinformation in so many different ways. Hi everyone, thanks so much for coming to the Teach the Teacher session... Phoebe, who was already a climate activist, started Teach the Teacher, which gives school children the resources to engage with their teachers on the issue.  Seventy-two per cent of young people say they’d like to learn more about climate change in school, but 70 per cent of teachers say don’t feel trained to teach about climate change... Phoebe, what gave you the idea for Teach the Teacher? As with a lot of things in the last couple of years, it started on a Zoom call.  My friend and co-founder Jodie Bailey-Ho, she was talking to us about her high school chemistry teacher who was a climate denier. He was teaching her about climate change, but was an active sceptic,  he didn't believe in it. And I think from that moment, we were, we wanted to do something about it.  We did a survey through a charity that works on education and climate change called students organising for sustainability. And we found that 70% of teachers feel that they haven't been given the adequate training to educate students on the climate crisis. But I've grown up with a teacher in my house, my Mum, I understand the pressure that teachers are under right now. So we decided to do something that was both helping teachers, but also holding them to account to the situation that we're in right now.  What was the reaction of the teachers to this, did they take it seriously? I mean, yes and no. Obviously, there's mixed reactions to students coming in and teaching their teachers. But overall, I think it's been really positive.  Today, Teach the Teacher is in 80 schools with funding to expand to more than 500 schools across the UK and it has global ambitions, operating in 25 countries around the world. And for Phoebe, the online lies and disinformation around climate change are one reason her project is crucial. It's training teachers so that they feel equipped to have those conversations and to be able to answer questions about what students  may have seen online and to be able to then combat those different pieces of disinformation they may have seen. And that disinformation is widespread and often conspiratorial.  I see a lot about climate activists, I see a lot about Greta Thunberg being like plants for various nefarious figures. I see a lot about climate change the roots of climate change, like not necessarily that climate change itself isn't real, but that the causes of climate change are not what we are being led to believe. Various things and in various forms, which is then the danger is that things keep popping up with different heads  and different accounts and different names and profiles and forms. And it's very, very difficult to be able to find reliable sources of information. Well, mis- and disinformation, I think it's fair to say don't exist in a vacuum, right.  Marco Silva is the BBC’s climate change disinformation reporter. He has been following the rise and shifting strategies of climate change deniers.   So whenever they pop up around the world, chances are they will be heavily influenced by local factors, the language, the politics, the culture, the local events, all of that will shape these narratives,  these false or misleading narratives, into something that is palatable to the local audiences.  Now, to give you a couple of examples, in recent months, I spent a bit of time looking at a propaganda network that was artificially promoting a crude oil pipeline in East Africa. Again, narrative focused specifically on that particular project in that particular area. But I also spent a bit of time fact checking claims around the construction of wind turbines offshore in the US and suggestions that the construction of these wind turbines was actually killing humpback whales.  So again these narratives tap into local concerns, local phenomena and local issues. But quite often, they will also showcase  patterns, patterns that for me, as a reporter, I tried to understand and I can, you know, see popping up in different parts of the globe in different guises, in different forms. One big shift has been the change from denying that human-made climate change is happening to saying it’s not that urgent.  Not only the science has advanced a lot more in our understanding of climate change, but also the level of public awareness about the science of climate change has also changed, which means people perhaps are far less susceptible than they would have been 20 years ago to buy into these denialist tropes. And so today what you've seen emerge is perhaps what some academics like to call 'delayism' and by that they mean narratives that raise questions about the urgency of climate change.  Yes, climate change is happening and it is manmade. But is it that urgent? Is it as bad as we all think it is, and if so, if it is, then why should I be the one taking action? Why not my neighbour? Why not that other country that has far bigger emissions than then we have? There are, of course, people who will peddle these  falsehoods for economic gain. And here we're thinking, for example, fossil fuel interests, lobbyist groups who have a lot to lose from pushing climate action. So if we turn our backs on fossil fuels, as the science suggests it is necessary, these industries stand to lose a lot of money. And as a result, some of those actors have become known for pushing, indeed, falsehoods and lies about climate change, for ideological reasons. This is The Documentary: Whose Truth? from the BBC World Service. Let’s take a moment now to hear how one of the world’s leading scientists thinks we should tackle climate change conspiracy theories. My name is Paul Nurse. I'm director of the Francis Crick Institute, a life sciences research institute in central London. Sir Paul Nurse was awarded a Nobel Prize for Medicine in 2001 and is one of the most influential scientists in Europe. When he was head of the UK’s Royal Society, he joined with America’s leading scientific organisation to commission a report putting science at the heart of the climate change debate. The problem with climate change is that it is also highly political. And this is what distorts the science, because the real issue is that  to deal with climate change requires political action. And some people feel that the political action that is needed, which is communal action, regulation across countries, regulations that can interfere and change the way the industry works, that means that they take up a position on the science which is actually driven by their politics. And disinformation and those who spread it can take advantage of the way science works and advances. One central pillar of science or of good scientists is to constantly attack your own ideas and your own position to try and see whether  it survives it. The climate change denialists have no sense of that. They simply look for tiny chinks in an argument and try and turn them politically into a big issue so that they can get their outcomes politically. And that's why it's been so dangerous, dangerous for the science, dangerous for the globe. But I do think we are slowly winning that battle. Climate change has been a hotbed for conspiracy theories, narratives, disinformation. Why do you think it makes it particularly fertile  territory for that kind of action and that kind of conversation? I think there's several reasons for it. One is this: Understanding climate is complex. It's not straightforward physics. There are many, many things going on. The second is the political message always, that if you don't like the outcome, that climate change is occurring and that outcome is, of course, much stronger regulation on industry on the way that we live, on the way we heat our homes, or transport, and so on, all interfering you could say with individual freedoms and in fact, some are anathema to you because of your political opinions, then they will resist it. [News archive] The floods came as a surprise. Victims were washed away in their   homes. The government is warning there will be more rain so some have packed up. Scientists say climate change is causing more intense and frequent extreme weather. The region is coming out of its   worst drought in 40 years. Thousands of people, \nlivestock and wildlife have died during four failed rainy seasons... The idea that global warming is not an urgent issue can be easier to sell in countries like the UK where the full impact of climate change is yet to be felt. But what about regions like East Africa where reports of extreme weather are becoming more frequent? Let’s go back to Nyombi Morris whose family had to leave their home in Uganda because of heavy floods. Yeah the message I wanted to share was how climate refugees can also lead climate action. That's what I wanted to share, because there are so many victims who can deliver their message out there.  Nyombi set up a non-profit organisation called Earth Volunteers to mobilise young people like him who wanted to promote the fight against climate change. They have planted more than 50,000 trees and reached more than 13,500 students. He’s also trying to get a climate school off the ground. Today we are growing. We have over 300 members, we have a project known as Climate School 2030, with a mission  to reach at least 1.5 million young people by 2030. We want to turn them into taking actions on the ground voluntarily, we don't want to force anyone, we just want you when you grow up, even if you're working, making billions of money, spare that small time and go back and do something in your community. And we are doing this through forming climate clubs in every school. Each climate club registers members and those are the members we are using to calculate our metrics to know 'okay, now we have 1.5 million young people'. So that's what we are doing. What would you say to those people who would argue that your situation, your personal situation, isn't about climate change and climate change doesn't exist?  First of all we have to understand why they say that because there are some that are putting this on religion despite the information that is out there by scientists, people are connecting this to religion and we have seen this every time wherever floods happens in the Arab world. People are always saying this is a punishment from Allah. This is a punishment, we need to do something, we need to ask Allah to forgive us. When it comes also even to Christians. There is floods. Sometimes, whenever there is floods or drought, you see people saying \"God is punishing us, we need to pray\". I'm not against a religion, but I just think that we have the power to change what we did as humans.  So let us go back to school, speak to their children, their children take back the information and the parents will love it. Because parents are always ready to listen to their children when they come back from school.  Sir Paul Nurse agrees.  Climate is now an important topic to be discussed at schools.  And what should we be exposing school children to? It's very important that they're connected to reliable sources of information and argument. That goes for the public as a whole, of course. But that's very important in a world of social media where there's bubbles of conflicting opinions. What this means is that individuals and young individuals in this instance can be completely influenced by a particular bubble that they're in. So part of the education has to be where is there reliable information? And will you be getting that from your social media contacts?  But we also should be, of course, part of the curriculum.  How do you feel about the future?  I'm an idealist and an optimist. I think we will tackle this problem. I don't think we are tackling it well enough yet. But we do see movement. And I think we need to rely on youth to drive that. We've already seen how youth can actually have a big impact. And I would say that I think it was the youth movement that has shifted opinion quite a lot in the last decade. So I am optimistic about that. But we have to help it and promote it, promoting it with our educational system, promoting it with a better democratic system, promoting it with a proper communication about decent science.   Climate change is the issue that will define my life and the lives of all children and young people right now. We’re the generation that are looked at as the ones to save the world, but we’re not really being given the tools to do that. I’m Babita Sharma and you’ve been listening to The Documentary: Whose Truth? a Nobel Prize Outreach and BBC World Service co-production. The series producers are Ian Rose and Clare Williamson with Philippa Goodrich. Our studio manager was Graham Puddifoot.

    "content": "We Earth system scientists\nand climate scientists are getting seriously nervous. The planet is changing faster\nthan we have expected. We are, despite years\nof raising the alarm, now seeing that the planet\nis actually in a situation where we underestimated risks. Abrupt changes are occurring in a way that is way beyond the realistic\nexpectations in science. Fifteen years back, I introduced\nthe planetary boundary framework, the scientific framework\nwith the nine Earth system processes that determines the stability,\nthe resilience and the life support on planet Earth. Ten years back, the world signed\nthe Paris Climate Agreement. Almost five years back,\nwe entered the decisive decade where our choices\nwill determine the future for all generations on planet Earth. Where are we on this journey, halfway into this decade? I will give you a scientific state\nof the planet report, the most objective assessment\nthat science can give today. And it starts here. We've reached 1.2 degree Celsius\nof global mean surface temperature rise, the warmest temperature on Earth over the past 100,000 years. We have just scratched\non 1.5 degree Celsius as an annual mean in 2023. But what worries us most is this: we are starting to see\nan acceleration of warming over the past 50 years. 0.18 degrees Celsius per decade\nfrom 1970 to 2010. But then from 2014 onwards, it abruptly jumps up to 0.26 per decade. And if we follow this path, we will crash through two degrees\nCelsius within 20 years and hit three degrees Celsius\nby the year 2100, a disastrous outcome, caused by us humans. But it's not only carbon dioxide. Any parameter that matters\nfor human well-being and our economies look the same. Here you have it, linear change\nup until the 1950s, we go into the great acceleration. And this is what we're seeing across\noverconsumption of fresh water, the sixth mass extinction of species, over-putrefying our freshwater systems\nwith nitrogen and phosphorus, all of it undermining\nthe stability of the planet. As if this was not enough, we are seeing that this is now causing\nimpacts across the entire economy. We're seeing bigger and bigger invoices being sent by the Earth system\nonto societies across the entire world, in droughts, floods, heat waves, disease patterns, human-reinforced storms, scientifically attributed\nto human-caused climate change. Forty degrees Celsius\nof life-threatening heat across all continents, occurring in 2023. Fifty-two degrees Celsius\nhitting the over 1,000 who lost their lives\nat the Hajj pilgrimage in June in Mecca. Three times higher climate change risks now attributed to our cause\nof climate change. 2023, up to 12,000 deaths, 200 billion US dollars of cost, just in the US,\nup to 100 billion US dollars. This is seriously causing economic costs. We have scientifically, in the past, shown that this could cost\na few percent of global GDP of the climate impacts caused by us. I can tell you that the latest\nscientific assessment is what you see on the screen here. An 18-percent loss of GDP by 2050 if we now follow the current path. This is equivalent to 38 trillion\nUS dollars of loss per year in 2050. It's starting to hurt. Both in human social costs\nand an economic cost. And this is happening\nat 1.2 degrees Celsius of global mean surface temperature rise. And we're following a pathway\nthat takes us to 2.7 degrees Celsius in only 70 years. And we've had a 10,000-year period\nwhere our civilizations have developed, where we've had an enormous privilege of a planet at 14 degrees Celsius, plus or minus 0.5 degrees Celsius. That's the Holocene\nsince we left the last ice age. And if you look three million years back, we never exceeded two degrees Celsius. That's the warmest temperature on Earth\nduring the entire Quaternary. The coldest point, minus five\ndegrees Celsius, Ice Age. I call this the “corridor of life.” Is it surprising that we scientists\nare getting really, really nervous? But it's more. It's so much more than this. The first issue is buffering capacity. The second is the risk\nof crossing tipping points, and both are moving\nin the wrong direction. Buffering capacity is the Earth system's\nability to dampen shocks and stress. Like, for example, soaking up\ngreenhouse gases in intact nature on land and in the ocean. And so far, Mother Earth\nhas been so forgiving. Here we have the evidence. What you see here is the hockey stick\nof fossil fuel burning in red and deforestation in yellow. Is it this tremendous climate forcing that has caused the 1.2-degree\nCelsius climate crisis so far? The answer is no. Fifty-three percent of the carbon dioxide from fossil fuel burning\nand land system change has been soaked up by intact nature on land and in the ocean. It’s only the blue sliver you see here, which remains in the atmosphere,\ncausing the climate crisis so far. The problem is we have more and more scientific\nevidence of cracks in this system. Let's start on land. Land absorbs 31 percent\nof the carbon dioxide from our greenhouse gas emissions. We have more and more scientific evidence\nacross so much research that the boreal forest in Canada, or the temperate mixed forest\nin Germany and Russia are starting to lose\ntheir carbon uptake capacity. Did you know that the latest science shows that the part of the Amazon rain forest, planet Earth's richest biome\non terrestrial land, has already tipped over\nand is no longer a carbon sink? It is today a carbon source. It's no longer helping us. But as if that was not enough, what really worries us today is the ocean. The ocean absorbs 90 percent of the heat caused by human-induced climate change. This is well understood, but what really worries us\nis what you see here. This is the latest data on sea surface\ntemperature across the ocean. What you see here\nis from 1980 until today, how gradually the ocean surface\njust gets warmer and warmer. It's actually warming all the way down\nto 2,000 meters depth. This is well understood in science. It's a deep concern. It's well represented\nin the climate models, we understand it. Then suddenly in 2023, something happens. Temperatures just go\ncompletely off the charts. 0.4 degrees Celsius outside\nof the warmest temperature in previous years. What's happening? We admittedly must be honest here, we do not know. El Niño is certainly partly to blame\nbut cannot explain it all. 2024, it just continues. What is happening? We do not know. But the candidate number one is the energy imbalance\ncaused by us humans. In one year alone, the heat equivalent to 300 times\nglobal electricity use is absorbed in the Earth's system. Is it what we see on the screen here, an ocean that is starting\nto lose resilience? An ocean that is at risk of releasing\nheat to the atmosphere and self-amplifying warming? We do not know. But one thing is for certain,\nthe ocean is sounding the alarm. Reasons for concern, yes. We are now at a point\nwhere we are forced to ask the following question: Are we at risk of pushing the planet\nout of the basin of attraction, the stability of the planet, where we’ve been\nsince we left the last Ice Age, the extraordinarily stable\nHolocene state? And if we pushed ourselves outside, drifting away unstoppably\ntowards a hothouse Earth where we get self-amplified warming and losing life support on Earth. What could take us there? Well, we know it. It is if we cross tipping points, big systems like the Greenland ice sheet, the overturning of heat\nin the North Atlantic, the coral reef systems, the Amazon rainforest\nare tipping element systems. Push them too far, and they will flip over\nfrom a desired state that helps us to a state that will self-amplify\nin the wrong direction, going from cooling and dampening\nto self-amplifying and warming. A rainforest tips over\nto a Savannah state. Now we have now mapped\nthe 16 tipping element systems, which are now scientifically cataloged,\nthat regulate the climate system. These 16, and you see the five\nin the ground zero on planet Earth, in the Arctic, are connected via cascades\nthrough the ocean, particularly via the AMOC, the Atlantic overturning\nof heat in the ocean, all the way down to Antarctica. These are big biophysical systems\nthat we all depend on, global commons for\nthe stability of the planet. The question is, at what temperatures\nare they at risk of tipping from helping us to becoming\nself-amplifying foes? Well, for the first time, we have an attempt\nto answer that question. What you see here are the 16 tipping\nelement systems on the y axis, and in red you see the uncertainty range, the best estimates in science, darker the red,\nthe higher the risk of tipping, it's the temperature levels at which they're likely\nto cross the threshold. The average temperature\nat which they are likely to tip is the yellow circle lines you see here. What this tells us is the following. Five of these 16 are likely\nto cross the tipping points already at 1.5 degrees Celsius. The Greenland ice sheet,\nthe West Antarctic ice sheet, abrupt thawing of permafrost, losing all tropical coral reef systems and collapse of the Barents Sea ice. And just the two ice sheets hold ten-meter sea level rise, which would be unstoppable\non the long term. Now sure, there is scientific\nuncertainty here, as you see from these graphs, but there's one red thread in science\nfor humanity in the scientific message. And it's this: the more we understand\nof the Earth's system, the higher is the risk. And here is the proof. This is five IPCC assessments the Intergovernmental Panel\non Climate Change, 30 years of scientific advancements. Here again you see risk assessment, darker the red, higher the likelihood\nof causing irreversible change in the climate system. Thirty years back, the risk\nwas put at five degrees Celsius of tipping and coming down\nto current state of science, the risk is set at 1.5\nto two degrees Celsius. We are in the midst\nof a danger zone today. But it can be even worse than that. Let's go to the Amazon basin, again, the richest terrestrial ecosystem on land, climate science estimates the risk of the Amazon rainforest\ntipping over irreversibly to a savanna at three to five degrees of global mean surface temperature rise. A really high temperature, unlikely even to be met\nover the next 70 years. But if we lose forest cover, the risk is that the system can\ntip already at 1.5 to two degrees Celsius if we lose more than 20\nto 25 percent of forest cover. So that's a very dangerous combination. Where are we today? We are at 1.2 degrees Celsius of global\nmean surface temperature rise and 17 percent of deforestation. We are very close to a tipping point\nin the Amazon rainforest. Very close. What shall we do to avoid\nthese unmanageable outcomes? Well, the IPCC is clear on the pathway. To stay under 1.5 degrees Celsius, to avoid crossing tipping points, we need to operate, to navigate\nwithin the global carbon budget that gives us a chance of holding 1.5. What remains for us is only 200 billion\ntons of carbon dioxide that we can continue emitting to have a 50 percent chance\nof holding 1.5. We emit today 40 billion tons\nof carbon dioxide per year, giving us five years\nat current rates of emission before we've consumed the budget. We are seriously running out of time. And the pathway for a safe landing\nis also well studied and understood. You have it here. Bend the curve of emissions immediately and follow a path\nwhere we reduce emissions by at least seven percent per year\nfor a safe landing and a net zero world economy by 2050. But it's more than that. We also know that even\nif we succeed with this, we have already loaded the atmosphere\nwith so much greenhouse gases, with so much climate forcing, that we inevitably face\na period of overshoot. We must now be prepared\nfor a very likely breaching of the 1.5-degree-Celsius\nplanetary boundary on climate somewhere between 2030 and 2035. In five to 10 year's time. And then have, at best,\na 30-40 year period of overshoot before we can come back\nto 1.5 by the end of this century. We would exceed\nwith 0.1 to 0.3 degrees Celsius the 1.5 limit, meaning up to 1.8 degrees Celsius. What does this tell us? Well, I can tell you there are\ntwo main messages. Message one: Buckle up. We know for certain,\n100 percent certainty, that this means\nmore droughts, more floods, more heat waves,\nmore human-reinforced storms, more disease during one generation's time. 2023, the warmest year on record, will be looked back upon as a mild year. Message two. Why would the planet come back\nto 1.5 after overshoot? Well, the answer is very simple. The health of the planet\nmust be kept intact. We must continue having a planet that can absorb 50 percent\nof the carbon dioxide. We must have a planet\nthat crosses no tipping points. We must have a planet that remains healthy and keeping heat intact in the ocean. That is why we need planetary boundaries. The planetary boundary framework that defines the nine\nEarth system processes that regulates the stability\nand resilience of the entire planet: climate, biodiversity, nitrogen,\nphosphorus, land, fresh water, air pollutants and chemicals. That is the challenge. To summarize that, there is no 1.5 degrees Celsius delivery on the Paris Agreement\nby only phasing out fossil fuels. We also need to come back\ninto the safe operating space of the nature-based biodiversity, all the planetary boundaries of nature. This means that science is clear. The window is rapidly closing, but there is still\nsome light in the window. We actually have evidence\nthat we've reached a pivotal point, not only in terms of risk, but also in terms of opportunity\nto transform the world towards a safe and just\nfuture for humanity. Linear change is no longer an option. The only option is exponential change. We know that the only currency\nthat matters is speed and scale. We also need to become stewards\nof the entire planet. We need to now recognize,\nfrom local to global level, that we're all so intertwined\nthat we must govern the entire planet. I know,  that is very daunting, but what choice do we have when on the line is the future\nof our children on planet Earth? And we have the solutions. We know that solving\nthe planet crisis is not utopia. It's not fantasy. We have the solutions for a secure,\nstable future for humanity. What are those transformations? Well, we know them. It's a rapid transition\naway from fossil fuels. It is a transition towards\ncircular business models. It is transitioning towards healthy diets\nfrom sustainable food systems. And it's not only halting loss of nature, it's also scaling the regeneration\nand restoration of marine systems, soils, forests and wetlands. We have solutions for all of these. Just take green energy, which today is cheaper\nthan fossil fuel-based energy. It's our choice that we're facing today. Now I was nervous already in 2020 when we entered this decisive decade and had to cut global emissions\nby half by 2030. Halfway into this decade, the road is steeper than ever. It's steeper than ever. This is what really, really concerns us. That we have a situation\nwhere we now need to move so fast. And I've been standing on stages\nlike this so many times, sharing the dire scientific diagnostic. But still, I just told you that I do conclude that there is\nstill some window open. There is a light in the tunnel. And you may ask, what is it\nthat makes me able to continue to be a realistic optimist\nin this situation? The most dire situation, I must admit,\nin my whole professional life. Well, actually, I promise\nthis is an honest statement. there are so many positive items as well. The most important one in my mind is that we have ample evidence that citizens across the world,\na majority of them, care about nature and climate. They trust climate science, they're concerned about climate change, and they want solutions. And the second key factor is that we have so much evidence today that the solutions are not only available, but if we implement them, we get a more healthy, stable, secure future with the jobs\nand the economies that can compete and provide\nlivelihoods into the future. This means, dear friends, that solving the planetary crisis\nis not only necessary, it is possible, and we all win if we succeed. Thank you very much. (Applause)"

    "content": "I'd like to offer a perspective that I don't see often shared by people discussing climate change so couple of points as you surely know all evidence gathered from many branches of science point to human induced changes in the climate of Earth since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution so you've heard that this contributes to the greenhouse effect the greenhouse effect is where visible light hits Earth's surface Earth's surface absorbs it and then reradiates it in the infrared and it's that infrared that gets trapped in the atmosphere raising the temperature that's the greenhouse effect in a nutshell there are multiple kinds of greenhouse gases uh water vapor is a greenhouse gas that's why uh humid environments the temperature doesn't Plunge very much at night when the sun sets look at the temperature range between midday and midnight in humid environments compared with very dry environments you can have a 40 degree Fahrenheit shift from daytime highs to nighttime lows in desert climates when you have a warmer Earth you can sustain more water vapor into the gas into the atmosphere you may have remembered from chemistry the warmer a solution is the more you can dissolve into it the more it can hold and we ask what are the consequences of that and everyone is saying I don't see any change what's a couple of degrees warmer there's a lot of that talk that's not the issue here I'm not here to debate with anybody whether the models that predicted a temperature rise were bang on low or high that's not my point my point is when you alter the climate in any way you are changing what Earth's surface experiences compared with historical averages so when Earth came out of its last ice age oh by the way I voiced a character in Ice Age 5 the film but billions and billions of years ago anyhow after the Ice Age our nomadic ancestors trying to not die from a Frozen Earth finally see an earth that warms up Naturally by the way but over thousands of years warm up and become relatively stable and they say to themselves this is pretty good and I don't I'm tired of wandering and I know how to control crops and I can control distribution of food goods and resources I'm going to build a city where you going to put a city you're going to put it on the water's edge be it ocean lake on a river typically why oh because it enables Transportation Commerce uh irrigation if you have crops all the greatest cities of the world were built on the bers edge now that you have a city there and you have this sort of long run of relatively stable climate post Ice Age what does that even mean oh stable climate doesn't mean nothing changes it means over the decades even over the centuries the city will see variations in the weather that are contained within a Zone within a band of variation so you measure that range within the city and then the city accommodates this fact how oh well if there's a period where there's a little bit of a drought you have a you build in water supply that'll help get you through a drought if it's get a certain amount of snow in modern times we you have a store of salt to put salt on the ground to melt the snow down to certain temperatures right if it's a little too hot you make sure that people have air conditioning do you realize the population of Texas went up significantly only after air conditioning became widespread and available what's going on here is for every city especially those built on the water's edge there is life experience of the records of that City that tell people what is the range of weather that they can experience in snowfall in rainfall and in temperature especially and the City Works to accommodate that range and you know something that's the range it has been in for thousands of years as these cities rose up to fit into the environment in which they were embedded you go to Los Angeles there's the LA River when I was first told it was an LA River I said that doesn't look like a river it looks like a cement Basin the LA River was built to accommodate flash floods which was in the knowledge of residents and in the range of expectations for the weather of the region if you're unfamiliar with the LA River it made a cameo in the Terminator series Terminator 2 especially arold is riding his motorcycle in and out of the LA River because it's just a little trickle which it is most of the time unless it rains heavily that is a protection system against what we knew are the ranges of rainfall that La would experience all right we are changing the climate climate change when you change the climate what happens is no longer is the life experience of everyone who's ever lived in your city the full measure of what is possible in that City and why that city was built climate change around the world will take you out of that stability Zone you could get less rain than ever before more rain than ever before temperatures can get colder than ever before hotter than ever before we are broadening the climactic experience that anyone has ever seen as we go forward we need to widen our expectations and understanding of what could possibly happen what happened in New York City a few years ago we had Hurricane Sandy by the way it wasn't even hurricane status by the time it came to New York but it had conditions that we had never seen in the history of the city the water level Rose so high it was higher than any previous level breached in the history of the city Waters spilled around the entrances to all to our tunnels oh my gosh major points of egress and Ingress between Manhattan and the rest of the world outside of our range outside of the life experience of the city so what did we do we had to pump out the tunnels that took a while all right there are these huge doors now that can close off the entrances and the exits to the tunnels that's a response to a new normal where the water levels might get higher than anyone had ever seen not only in our lives but in the life of the city itself so as we go forward yeah cities are going to have to do this you're going to have to be ready for climactic events that fall outside of your experiences the effects of climate change will not impact everyone equally around the world consider for example there whole countries Island countries in the Pacific where their average land elevation is low compared with sea level as the world warms and we lose our ice cap from Antarctica and Greenland which are the two major ice caps in the world that melts back into the oceans it's going to change the water levels and flood those countries the military knows about this they're called climate refugees people whose country is gone because the warming of the earth changed the water levels that surrounded their countries and England it's getting warmer in England a little bit outside their Zone okay there's rumors that they're now making champagne in England okay that's different for their economy that's also a consequence of climate change and in one of the airports in England a couple of years ago during one of the heat waves the tarmac was melting planes couldn't land and the recent cold wave that emerged out of Canada down into the United States it reached the Gulf States shattering records for snowfall in Alabama Mississippi Louisiana so I just wanted to add some perspective to what it means when we talk about climate change get ready for the new normal and in most places on Earth it's not going to be pretty"

    "content": "Hi, I’m David. I'm a playwright from Ngunnawal country, the unceded lands of the Ngunnawal people in southeast Australia. I come from a family\nof climate scientists, and in 2014 I wrote a play\nentitled \"Kill Climate Deniers.\" (Laughter) The play follows the story\nof a group of eco-terrorists who take over Australia's Parliament House during a Fleetwood Mac concert and hold the entire government hostage, demanding an instant end\nto climate change. So the story is ridiculous, but I wanted the play\nto start a conversation about what happens when the unstoppable\nforce of climate change meets the immovable object of politics. OK so obviously the title\n“Kill Climate Deniers” is provocative. But just to be clear, when I wrote it,\nI wasn't targeting anyone real. Now thanks to the work of journalists\nand scientists like Naomi Oreskes, we know how climate denial began. Oil and gas companies recognized\nthe issue of greenhouse gas emissions back in the 1950s and '60s. They set out to cast doubt on the science. They funded lobby groups,\nmarketing firms, politicians. They astroturfed an entire\nclimate denial movement into being. So now there's this industry\nof pundits and journalists who make a living denying\nthe reality of climate change. When I made the statement\n\"Kill Climate Deniers,\" I expected outrage from these people. But I did not expect pushback\nfrom the general public. I figured there are no\nreal climate deniers. If there are regular, normal people\nwho don't believe in climate science, they can't be that passionate. So I was very wrong. (Laughter) Now to begin with, the play received\nexactly the attention I expected from exactly the people I expected. When the first production\nwas announced in 2014, a conservative politician\nin my hometown of Canberra called for the play to be shut down. There were angry articles\nin the Murdoch press Breitbart, Infowars, all the usual suspects\nin the right-wing media machine. Some of these pundits accused the play\nof being an \"incitement to terrorism,\" and they referred me to the police. Their argument was that people\nwould see the show and be inspired to take\nan entire government hostage to end climate change. Now the theater company\ndidn’t have money for lawyers or a crisis communications team, so out of concern for the actors' safety,\nthe production was cancelled. But I didn't like backing down. It didn't feel good. I felt as if giving up on the project was like agreeing\nwith the people attacking it. And I did not agree with them. The play was not\nan incitement to terrorism. But no theater company\nwas willing to take the risk of being referred to the police. I couldn't get it up as a show. So instead, my musician friend\nReuben Engel turned it into an album. Reuben sampled dialogue from the play and wove it into a series\nof original electronic tracks. We toured that record around Australia. We couldn't get into theaters, so we went to nightclubs,\nwe held dance parties. Then we launched an unauthorized\ncovert walking tour of Parliament House. People downloaded a special version\nof the album on headphones and listened to the music and the story while walking around the real-life setting\nof Australia's halls of power. Like so. (Applause) (Music) (Music ends) Now all of this helped to build up\nan audience for the project. But even more importantly,\nthere were no real-life copycats. Not one government building\nwas taken hostage by eco-terrorists during a Fleetwood Mac concert. So four years after the original\nproduction was canceled, the play finally made it\nto the stage in 2018 at the Griffin Theatre in Sydney, followed by productions in Prague,\nLondon, Los Angeles and so on. Obviously I was very happy. And in one version of the story, that's where it ends. This project just joins\na long list of things right-wing commentators have found\nto be outraged about, alongside Elvis, smartphones, twerking, Miley Cyrus, Fortnite, the Beat Generation, skateboarding, Woodstock, Woodstock '99, sugary cereal, TikTok, gay marriage, NWA, feminism, the Twist, Dungeons and Dragons, LiveJournal, shopping malls\nand women reading novels. (Laughter) But as the play made\nits way into the world, something else started happening. I started hearing from climate deniers. And not fossil-fuel pundits or right-wing journalists, real climate deniers. Regular, normal people. And I couldn't get my head around it. Like, why did they care so much? Like, if you're an ExxonMobil executive, then you have a financial incentive\nto downplay climate science. But if you're a high school\nteacher in Queensland or a massage therapist in Massachusetts, why would you spend\nyour nights and weekends desperately trying to debunk\nEarth science research? Now it turns out that although\nclimate denial began as an astroturfed movement\ncreated by fossil fuel companies, it caught on because it connects\nwith a certain group of people in a very real way. I got emails, I got physical letters,\nI got phone calls. They started showing up\nto performances of the play. And as the show got bigger and bigger, there were more and more of them,\nand they were passionate. I wanted this play to start\na conversation, and it did. It just was not the conversation\nI thought I was starting. I ended up speaking\nwith hundreds of climate deniers over the course of this project. Now some of them wanted\nto insult me and threaten me. Some of them wanted to tell me\nvariations on the same gag, like, \"What if I wrote a play\ncalled 'Kill Climate Scientists?'\" But some of them were interesting. These deniers wanted to explain to me\nwhy climate science was wrong. They had a whole worldview. They said, \"The reality is, David, that climate change is a made up excuse for a huge program\nof top-down intervention. What climate activists really want\nis to stifle our freedoms. They want to control what we eat, they want to choke the life\nout of rural communities, and they want to throw the doors open\nto massive global migration.\" Now I wanted to respond\nto these people and say, \"I'm sorry, you're wrong. That's not what it's about.\" But the more I talked with them,\nthe more I realized... They're right. They are completely correct. I mean, they're not correct about climate\nchange being a made up excuse. That, sadly, is not true. But the consequences of climate change? Yes, diets are going to change. Yes, a lot of communities in exposed\nlocations will be forced to leave. Yes, there will be huge\nmovements of people within and between countries,\nthey're right. And we don't even realize\nhow right they are. I believe in the science\nof climate change, and so do probably most\nof the people in this room. But more often than not, we go about our lives as if it's not real. We plan our careers, we build houses, we educate our children\nas if the future will look like the past. But the world we're educating\nthem for no longer exists. At one degree warming, we are already on a planet unlike anywhere\nhumans have ever lived in the past, and our systems are starting\nto buckle under the strain. Now whether you believe\nthat we are sleepwalking into disaster or if you think we're going to turn\nthings around through high-tech solutions or massive social movements, whatever climate future you believe in, our lives are going to radically change. Our future will not look like our past. We accept the science, but we haven't processed the consequences. We don't explicitly deny climate change, but in our actions,\nwe're like soft deniers, stealth deniers. I'm one of these people. Maybe you are too. I keep my carbon footprint\nas low as possible. But then I got on a plane\nto give this talk. I read research reports about which cities\nwill be vulnerable in future decades to climate shocks, resource shocks. And then I forget all that and think, I just want to buy a flat in my hometown. If you believe something\nbut you act like you don't believe it, do you really believe it? Now climate deniers understand\nthe consequences of the science,  so they don't accept the science. They know what it means if it's true,\nso they won't allow it to be true. I think we can learn from climate deniers. I want to be more like that high school\nteacher in Queensland, that massage therapist in Massachusetts, because they live what they believe. You and I, we think we know better. We are the ones in denial. And I know deep down\nthat the longer we deny reality, the harder the shock when it hits. Thank you. (Applause)"

    "content": "A series on this channel talking about the\nenvironment without focusing on the era-defining change happening to our planet right now wouldn’t\nmake any sense. Climate Change is after all, the hot mess\nwe all find ourselves in. Climate is the long-term, average weather\nover a particular region. It’s the typical patterns of temperature,\nprecipitation, wind and how those change seasonally throughout the year. But what does that actually mean? Let’s take a trip to a few biomes and compare\nwhat climate looks like around the world. We’re going to the tropical rainforest of\nBrazil, the savanna of Mozambique, the desert in Saudi Arabia, and the tundra of Canada. Now, the daily weather might change a lot\nin these biomes, depending on the day, the Candaian tundra could be hotter than the desert,\nbut what we’re interested in is the climate. A useful tool for comparing climates like\nthese are climatograms, which visually represent the climate of a region throughout time. This gives us not only an idea of what the\nclimate is, how much rain and how warm, but also, the seasonal patterns. On average, the desert and the tundra are\nboth very dry, without much rainfall, but a desert is hotter than the tundra. Tropical rainforests and savannas are both\nhot, but you’ll see a lot more precipitation in the Brazilian rainforest than this savanna. Clearly, climates vary widely, from the frigid,\ndry tundra to the hot and humid rainforests, but what causes all these different regional\nclimates? As Joe mentioned in the first episode of this\nseries, terrestrial biomes are defined by their temperature and precipitation - basically\ntheir climate. And the main driver of temperature on this\nplanet? That’d be the sun. Now, if our planet wasn’t more or less spherical,\nand was like a flat sheet, everywhere on earth would experience the same solar insolation. Solar insolation is the amount of heat energy\nfrom the sun, or solar radiation, that hits an area. But, because Earth is a sphere, solar energy\nfrom the sun hits different parts of the globe at different angles. The equator is so warm because the incoming\nsolar radiation is perpendicular to the surface. Up at the poles that angle is more oblique. The sun is emitting the same amount of heat\nenergy, but in the equator that energy is more concentrated while at the poles it's\nmore spread out. Imagine shining a flashlight on a basketball. Near the middle, the light from the flashlight\nis a perfect circle, but as you move the flashflight up it becomes more oblong. This unequal heating of the Earth’s surface\ncauses the difference in temperature, but it also drives much of the global climate. Because sunlight doesn’t just heat the ground,\nit also heats the air. When heated, the molecules of air expand,\nbecoming less dense and rise. As those molecules get higher up in the atmosphere\nthey begin to cool down, become denser again and sink. These rising and falling air masses create\nglobal wind patterns that act like enormous conveyor belts, transporting not just heat\nbut also moisture all over the planet. Warm air holds more water vapor and cooler\nair holds less. This is because warmer air molecules have more energy and move around more so the water vapor can't condense out. As that air rises, cools, and becomes less energized, suddenly the colliding water molecules can condense instead of bouncing off each other, changing from water vapor into liquid water droplets. And that often means precipitation like rain\nor snow. The heat energy from the sun spread unevenly\nacross the planet drives wind patterns and the hydrologic cycle. And all together, these cycles of wind, rain,\nand heat form the basis for the variety of climate patterns on Earth. The sun, and unequal solar insolation on the\nsurface, drives the entire climate system, but, the sun alone doesn’t make all this work. The earth also has a kind of ‘blanket’\nof molecules that trap some of the sun’s heat, and without it, all that solar insolation\nwould hit the earth and then head right back into space. This blanket is the greenhouse effect. And it is what makes our planet liveable. Without it, Earth’s temperatures would swing\nwildly, more like Mars or the Moon, with freezing cold nights and warm to blazing hot days. The greenhouse effect gets its name from,\nwell, greenhouses. Greenhouses are great places to grow plants,\nall year long, because they trap the sun’s heat. The transparent glass or plastic of a greenhouse\nroof lets in sunlight, warming the air and the plants and the everything inside. But, when that heat energy tries to leave\nthe greenhouse a lot of it is reflected back inside. The greenhouse gases in the atmosphere do\nbasically the same thing. Incoming solar radiation - heat energy from\nthe sun - heads toward the earth. A lot of this energy is absorbed by the ground,\nwater, trees, warming everything up. Some of it is reflected by the atmosphere\nand clouds, or other objects at the surface with high albedo, or reflectiveness, like\nglaciers, and heads back out into space. Where things really start to warm up, and\ngreenhouse gases get involved, is when an object, like a road or a lake, absorbs all\nthat heat from the sun and it starts to give off heat of its own. Which is why walking across pavement without\nshoes on can be a painful experience in the summer. Compared to the energy from the sun, that\nre-emitted heat has a longer wavelength, in the infrared of the light spectrum. And when any of that infrared, re-emitted\nenergy hits a greenhouse gas molecule, that molecule is able to absorb that energy and\nre-radiate it, warming the atmosphere. Like a real-greenhouse’s windows, greenhouse\ngases are like a big blanket or jacket, wrapping the earth keeping heat trapped inside. The greenhouse gas molecules in the atmosphere\nplay a critical role in regulating the temperature of our planet. Keeping things fairly stable, without massive\ntemperature shifts between scorching days and frigid nights. But, it is a balanced system. Too few greenhouse gases in the atmosphere\nand things start to get a bit chilly, and when we add additional greenhouse gases, we’re\nmaking the planet warmer. Climate change happens when the balance of\ngreenhouse gases is thrown out of whack. Which means, if we, and the rest of the organisms\non the planet, want to live as we do now, then we should be concerned about the amount\nof greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Just to make this crystal clear: the higher\nthe concentration of greenhouse gases there are in the atmosphere, the more heat will\nbe trapped and the greater the overall global temperature. Now that you know what greenhouse gases do,\nlet’s talk about what greenhouse gases are. There are a lot of different greenhouse gases,\nbecause this umbrella term includes any molecules that absorb outgoing long-wave radiation from\nthe earth. But some play a bigger role than others - so\nwe’re only going to focus on three: carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. These aren’t the molecules that trap the\nmost overall heat: that’d be water vapor, or the most heat per molecule: sulfur hexafluoride\nearns that title. These are the greenhouse gases that humans\nare adding lots of and are causing the most overall warming. Let’s start with carbon dioxide. Perhaps the most infamous of the bunch. Let’s look at a graph of paleoclimate that\nreaches way back into geologic history. This data behind this chart comes from ice\ncores, because trapped in long-ago frozen ice are tiny bubbles of air that still look\nlike the atmosphere when they froze. You can probably see a pattern here. When global temperature is low, CO2 in the\natmosphere is low, when the global temperature is high, CO2 in the atmosphere is high. Even without doing any analysis of the actual\nnumbers, we can see that temperature and CO2 concentrations are correlated. We can also see that there is a cyclical pattern,\nand that the highs and low points have been roughly the same as far back as this model\ngoes. These long-term cyclical patterns show the\nnatural fluctuations of temperature and carbon dioxide, caused by things like the slowly\nshifting tilt and orbit of the earth. And when I say slowly, I mean really slowly. Look at the horizontal x-axis on this chart. The distance between the peaks is hundreds\nof thousands of years - a length of time so long that I personally have no frame of reference\nfor. Now, take a look at the end of this graph. Carbon dioxide spikes up, way higher than\nwe’ve ever seen in the ice-core records. We talked about this chart in the episode\non the atmosphere, but this is the Keeling curve. A daily-record of carbon dioxide concentration\nat Mauna Loa, Hawaii since 1958. There’s two distinct trends here: the small\nyearly fluctuations and an overall trend upward. Those yearly fluctuations are because of less\nphotosynthesis, and therefore less drawdown of CO2, occurring during the northern hemisphere\nwinter months. The northern hemisphere has more land mass,\nso the seasonal cycle of trees and grasses has an impact on global carbon dioxide concentrations. During the northern hemisphere summer, when\nall the plants wake up, photosynthesis rates go up, plants drawdown carbon dioxide out\nof the air and transform it into organic compounds. The yearly cycle is natural, and expected,\nand has probably been going on for millennia - it is that upward trend that is worth worrying\nabout. And if you look at the numbers, the increasing\ncarbon dioxide concentration is exponential, with the rate of increase growing every year. This exponential increase is because of humans,\ncaused largely by deforestation, and by burning fossil fuels - for heating, transportation,\nindustrial uses, and electricity. Deforestation is a double whammy emissions-wise\nbecause forests serve as a carbon sink. Trees sequester carbon in their tissues, trapping\nit for a very long time. Not only does cutting down those trees end\nup releasing that stored carbon, but it also means fewer old-growth trees to sequester\nthe carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Reducing fossil fuel use and deforestation\nis essential to reducing carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere and slowing future warming. Alright, now let’s talk about methane. Methane has some naturally occurring sources,\nlike wetlands, but human emissions primarily come from landfills, raising cattle, and the\ngas industry. At a landfill, the organic material buried\ninside all of that trash starts to decompose in anaerobic - or oxygen free - environments. Cattle produce methane as part of their digestive\nprocess, and with millions of farmed cattle on Earth, those cow burps make up a major\nmethane source. And mining, transportation, and use of liquified\nnatural gas (which is mainly methane) are also serious sources. Finally, we have nitrous oxide. Technically laughing gas, but definitely not\nfunny. This greenhouse gas is generated as a by-product\nof fertilizer on agricultural fields. Nitrogen is one of the limiting factors in\nmost soils, regulating how many plants can grow. To increase the yield, and to maintain soil\nfertility, farmers add nitrogen to their fields. While that helps the plants grow, bacteria\nin those fields convert that nitrogen into nitrous oxide. The more fertilizer used, the more nitrous\noxide emissions. Even though it is well understood that increased\ngreenhouse gases cause climate change, emissions of all of these greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide,\nmethane, and nitrous oxide are still rising. Which is… not great. But why, what does increased greenhouse gases\nand the resulting climate change actually mean for humans and the environment? Well the obvious - it will get hotter. And it has, the global average temperature\nhas already increased more than 1 degrees Celsius since the 1800s. But that’s just the global average, some\nplaces are getting warmer faster - like the poles. And temperatures going up alone isn’t the\nissue, because the planet warming up also causes changes in the climate. At different temperatures molecules in the\nair and ocean behave differently, so as things heat up, we see changes in wind patterns,\nprecipitation, and ocean currents. In some areas this means increased droughts\nand forest fires, in others, more frequent floods and stronger hurricanes. Devastating hazards aren’t the only impact\nof climate change though. As parts of the planet become warmer, we also\nsee habitats disappearing or shifting - with dramatic consequences for the biosphere. Every organism has a range of tolerance for\nabiotic factors, like salinity, pH, and temperature. If those factors become too extreme, the organism\nhas to move or die. Some species have been moving their home ranges\nin response to changing temperature patterns. For example, lobsters off the eastern coast\nof North America are shifting northward in search of cooler waters. But other species, where moving isn’t as\n‘easy’ - like certain tree species - are disappearing. Climate change is also messing with the seasons. Phenological spring, the time of year when\nplants start to bud new growth, has occurred earlier in response to a warming planet. For instance, researchers have tracked the\ndate that cherry trees blossom in Japan based on centuries of diary entries and chronicles. After twelve hundred years of a nice steady\ncycle, the peak for cherry blossoms in Japan has been getting earlier and earlier thanks\nto climate change. The oceans are becoming warmer too. And as you may remember from episode three\n- the oceans make up a huge portion of the planet. So increased temperatures in the oceans have\nramifications all over. The oceans are warming fastest at the surface,\nwhich leads to an increase in a thing called ocean stratification. Basically, the ocean, or really any mildly\ndeep body of water has layers with distinct temperature and light infiltration. Because the surface water warms faster than\nthose below this increases the distinction between the upper layers of the ocean and\nlower layers. Some stratification is normal and important\nfor nutrient flow, but like most things, when you turn the dial to 11, we start to see problems. Like, less upwelling and nutrient mixing,\nwhich usually brings cold water full of nutrients to the surface. Without the flow of nutrient-rich deep water,\nocean surface organisms can’t survive. Phytoplankton - a broad category of microalgae\nthat like to float around the surface - don’t do super well without those nutrients. Which would be bad on its own, because phytoplankton\nare an integral part of the marine food web - acting like terrestrial plants converting\nenergy from sunlight into their little bodies - but phytoplankton are, through the sheer\namount of photosynthesis they do, both a major source of oxygen and pull literal tons of\ncarbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. Both things we humans rely on for a stable\nclimate. Increasing ocean temperatures also means rising\nsea levels. Like the air, as water temperature increases, the energized water molecules take up more volume. One drop of water expanding a tiny tiny bit\ndoesn’t change much, but when you multiply that by the immense volume of an ocean, from\nthis thermal expansion alone, global average sea level rises 1.4ish mm a year. And increasing temperatures also melt ice. Ice melt from land-based ice, like the greenland\nice sheet, accounts for 1.8 mm a year of global average sea level rise. A few millimeters is admittedly very small,\nif you’re thinking about your local beach. But this is average rise, so in some places\nocean levels are rising faster. And, it’s rising a few millimeters every\nsingle year, and that adds up. This means by 2100 we could see more than\na meter of sea level rise. Which, again, might not sound like much, but\nwhen you consider the risk of storm surge and coastal flooding, every extra centimeter\nputs coastal communities and millions of people at risk. Pumping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere\ndoesn’t just raise ocean temperatures - it also causes ocean acidification. But all that extra CO2 in the ocean turns\ninto carbonic acid and drops the pH of the water, taking a normal part of the carbon\ncycle and supercharging it. Shellfish and other organisms that construct\ntheir shells and skeletons out of calcium carbonate, are literally dissolving away or\nhaving a hard time growing their shells in the first place because of ocean acidification. Of course, all the impacts of climate change\non the biosphere affect humans because we rely on their ecosystem services. As we’ve talked about in previous episodes,\nthe oceans, atmosphere, and soil provide the backbone for the entirety of human society. When climate change starts messing up those\nsystems, we’re going to feel it. Correction: We’re already are. But who is ‘we’ here? In theory, climate change is a global problem. The average global temperature is increasing,\nbut who feels the effects of that temperature increase and all the ramifications from heat\nwaves, to hurricanes, to flooding. That isn’t evenly distributed. Disproportionately the impacts of climate\nchange fall on low income communities and communities of color. Wealthier, and often whiter, communities with\nmore access to resources can in some ways, buy themselves out of some of the worst impacts. This inequity is called Environmental Injustice\nor Climate Injustice. And if you want to learn more, we’ve made\na whole playlist for you to watch. So what’s to be done? That’s the big question when it comes to\nclimate change. And unfortunately there isn’t a single answer. The global climate is a massive interconnected\nsystem. So we need big solutions, and we need solutions\nfor everyone - not just folks with the biggest paychecks. Generally speaking, though, these solutions\nfall into two categories: adaptation and mitigation. We can adapt systems and structures to the\nnew and future climate systems. In response to sea level rise, this means\nbuilding flood barriers or moving homes and businesses away from low lying coastal areas. As temperatures rise, adaptive measures look\nlike drought-tolerant crops, or cooling centers, which are free, air-conditioned spaces for\npeople to escape deadly heat. Adaptation also means developing policy and\ngovernance structures to support people displaced by sea level rise, or cyclones, or droughts. Adaptation helps preserve human life and systems,\nby responding to the impacts of climate change, but it doesn’t tackle the cause of climate\nchange: emissions. Mitigation strategies are solutions that decarbonize,\nor reduce greenhouse gas emissions, like replacing coal and gas power plants with renewable power\ngeneration, developing public transportation systems and decreasing vehicle miles, or reducing\nfood waste. Mitigation also includes strategies that increase\ncarbon storage, like preserving old-growth forests and protecting peatland. We’re already experiencing the effects of\nclimate change, so for many places, adaptation strategies are necessary. But alone, adaptation will not be able to\nprotect everyone from ever increasing climate risk A focus on mitigation efforts, and lots of\nthem, in concert with adaptation strategies is required to combat climate change. Climate change and climate science are their\nown field of study, but hopefully this video gives you a sense of how climate fits into\nthe field of environmental science, from modeling and basic research to its impact on ecosystems\nand ecosystem services, and even its own tangled web of policy questions. There’s a lot more to say about climate,\nbut luckily you’re on a whole channel that focuses on it. So after you’re done with this series, we’ve\ngot plenty more for you. For now, thanks for watching, and we’ll\nsee you next time for a look at energy."

    "content": "- Picture a map of Florida with its long sandy beaches and wetlands, or cities like New York,\nVenice, and Alexandria, all metropolises with some\npretty watery boundaries. Now, try to picture what these\nmight look like in 100 years. The Sunshine State might\nlook very different than it does today. The same goes for\nManhattan Island or Mumbai. This is our best guess of a warmer future, one where sea levels are gnawing away at the corners of our\ncarefully drawn maps. Coastal cities are first\nin line for big changes, and some that can afford it are\ngearing up to spend billions to make sure they survive. - You might think of the great ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica\nas giant banks of freezers. And we're running down those rows of freezers unplugging them. - That's Ben Strauss, CEO and Chief Scientist\nof Climate Central. They're a non-profit organization that researches and\nreports on climate change including sea level rise. Researchers like Ben have\nconcluded that the world is guaranteed to see four\nfeet of sea level rise by 2100 just based on greenhouse gases we've already put into the atmosphere. - Once we unplug a\nfreezer, it's unplugged. You can't plug it back in\nand it's going to melt. - That's pretty scary, especially\nif you live on a coast. And according to the UN, more than 600 million\npeople live in coastal areas that are less than 30\nfeet above sea level. And any amount of further emissions will cause sea levels to rise higher, with scientists like Ben expecting a rise of 10 to 20 feet or more\nby the end of this century. Some coastal areas are already struggling. During some high tides in Miami, water already slides across city streets. This is happening now and it's a physical sign\nof rising sea levels. - There are already neighborhoods\nin the United States that I know about where real\nestate value has evaporated because floods that used\nto be rare or non-existent now happen multiple times a year. It's a block here or a block there, but it's really affecting people. - Climate Central created a\nvisualizer called Surging Seas to drive this point home. It shows how coastal cities will fare as the climate heats up. Look at New York, New\nOrleans, Shanghai or Lagos, and you'll see how melting ice\ncould push shorelines inland. It's one of a few projects online that are designed to make\nthe threat feel immediate. - I think climate change\ntends to be such an abstract and distant seeming\nproblem for most people. We want to make it as real\nand personal as possible. People being able to look\nup their own neighborhood, their own home helps to do that. - Here in New York, the sea\nlevel is actually rising faster than in lots of other\nparts of the country. We did a whole video about it. Anyway, earlier this year, the city unveiled an ambitious plan to keep the lower part of Manhattan safe. - I often said after\nSandy, you don't find a lot of climate change\ndeniers in New York City. - They plan to fortify the city. It may actually build\noutland into the East River by 50 to 100 feet. It's not the first time that New York has\nreclaimed land from water, but prior expansions were mostly done to increase living space, this one will be to keep the water away from our living rooms. The plan will cost an\nestimated 10 billion dollars. - We can't overstate the\ndisruption that it would cause to take no action, so we\nabsolutely have to act. - Jainey Bavishi is the Director of the Mayor's Office of Resiliency. Her team collaborated on a big study that looked into the climate\nrisks faced by Lower Manhattan. - So we didn't just look at\nsea level rise and storm surge, but we also looked at\n(mumbling) precipitation and extreme heat. And across the city, we're taking steps to address\nthese multiple hazards and multiple risks that we\nface from climate change. - For anyone living near the coast, sea level rise presents problems. But for cities, the\nissues are really unique. - Imagine water pouring into\nthe streets on a regular basis just during high tide. You open your door and you walk into a\nstreet filled with water. It would impact underground\ninfrastructure that we rely on. Imagine subway tunnels getting\nflooded on a regular basis or the foundations of buildings corroding. - In addition to building\nout into the river, the city plans to install\nflood gates at critical places that would flip up in a flood to keep water out of low-lying land. But for now, these plans\nare still just concepts. They aren't even sure how\nthey'll pay for it yet, but private funding is still on the table. - We're not planning for development, but that also depends on whether or not we're able to get funding\nfrom the federal government. We'll have to figure\nout how to finance this. If funding doesn't come\nfrom the federal government, then development might\nbe part of the solution. - [Mary Beth] Wandering\naround Lower Manhattan, it's spooky to think\nabout how dramatically climate change could\nredraw these city blocks. And it's obvious that\none threatened area here is driving a lot of the\nurgency, Wall Street. - So Lower Manhattan is an\neconomic center of the city. One in 10 jobs are located\nin Lower Manhattan. 75% of subway lines go\nthrough Lower Manhattan. So we know that we need\nto protect Lower Manhattan in order to protect the economic\nvitality of New York City. - But in a lot of places\nin the U.S. alone, extreme preventative measures like New York's are out of reach. Two communities, one in Alaska\nand another in Louisiana are relocating to get away\nfrom rapidly eroding coasts. And a 2018 study found that as many as 311,000\nhouses in the United States will be vulnerable to\nchronic flooding by 2045. In other words, climate\nmigration is already a reality. And policy makers here in New\nYork want to avoid the chaos that could come from displacing a city of almost nine million people. - You can't just pick up\nand move a city very easily and because cities are such\nimportant concentrations of human lives and economic activity, I think we will invest a\ngreat deal in defending them. I don't expect us to be\ntrying to move Manhattan. I expect us to be defending\nit as vigorously as we can. - We might not have as much time to build out the barricades\nas you might think. While most projections focus on 2100, it's not like sea levels will wait 'til 2099 to suddenly attack. Water will trickle in slowly,\nseeping into our lives and disrupting infrastructure,\nproperty values, and coastlines in the process. It won't be sudden, but it will be fast. - It's the speed of change that I think is the most\ndangerous thing about it. A bullet isn't dangerous if\nI'm holding it in my hand or throwing it at you. It's the speed of the bullet\nthat makes it dangerous. It's the speed of climate\nchange and sea level rise which are going to make them dangerous. - If you want to learn\nmore about sea level rise including why it doesn't rise at the same rate in all places, check out our other video and don't forget to subscribe.

    "content": "In 1992, a cargo ship carrying bath toys \ngot caught in a storm. Shipping containers washed overboard, and the waves swept 28,000 rubber ducks \nand other toys into the North Pacific. But they didn’t stick together. Quite the opposite– the ducks have since washed up \nall over the world, and researchers have used their paths to chart a better understanding\nof ocean currents. Ocean currents are driven \nby a range of sources: the wind, tides, changes in water density, and the rotation of the Earth. The topography of the ocean floor \nand the shoreline modifies those motions, causing currents to speed up, slow down, or change direction. Ocean currents fall into \ntwo main categories: surface currents and deep ocean currents. Surface currents control the motion of the top 10 percent \nof the ocean’s water, while deep-ocean currents mobilize \nthe other 90 percent. Though they have different causes, surface and deep ocean currents \ninfluence each other in an intricate dance that keeps \nthe entire ocean moving. Near the shore, surface currents are driven \nby both the wind and tides, which draw water back and forth \nas the water level falls and rises. Meanwhile, in the open ocean, wind is the \nmajor force behind surface currents. As wind blows over the ocean, it drags the top layers \nof water along with it. That moving water pulls on \nthe layers underneath, and those pull on the ones beneath them. In fact, water as deep as 400 meters is still affected by the wind \nat the ocean’s surface. If you zoom out to look at the patterns \nof surface currents all over the earth, you’ll see that they form \nbig loops called gyres, which travel clockwise \nin the northern hemisphere and counter-clockwise \nin the southern hemisphere. That’s because of the way \nthe Earth’s rotation affects the wind patterns that\ngive rise to these currents. If the earth didn’t rotate, air and water would simply \nmove back and forth between low pressure at the equator and high pressure at the poles. But as the earth spins, air moving from the equator to the \nNorth Pole is deflected eastward, and air moving back down \nis deflected westward. The mirror image happens \nin the southern hemisphere, so that the major streams of wind form loop-like patterns \naround the ocean basins. This is called the Coriolis Effect. The winds push the ocean beneath \nthem into the same rotating gyres. And because water holds onto heat \nmore effectively than air, these currents help redistribute \nwarmth around the globe. Unlike surface currents, deep ocean currents are driven primarily \nby changes in the density of seawater. As water moves towards the North Pole, it gets colder. It also has a higher \nconcentration of salt, because the ice crystals that form \ntrap water while leaving salt behind. This cold, salty water is more dense, so it sinks, and warmer surface water takes its place, setting up a vertical current called \nthermohaline circulation. Thermohaline circulation of deep water \nand wind-driven surface currents combine to form a winding loop \ncalled the Global Conveyor Belt. As water moves from the depths of \nthe ocean to the surface, it carries nutrients that nourish the \nmicroorganisms which form the base of many \nocean food chains. The global conveyor belt is the\nlongest current in the world, snaking all around the globe. But it only moves a few \ncentimeters per second. It could take a drop of water \na thousand years to make the full trip. However, rising sea temperatures are \ncausing the conveyor belt to seemingly slow down. Models show this causing havoc with \nweather systems on both sides of the Atlantic, and no one knows what would happen if it \ncontinues to slow or if it stopped altogether. The only way we’ll be able to forecast\ncorrectly and prepare accordingly will be to continue to study currents \nand the powerful forces that shape them."

    "content": "In January of 1953, a tidal surge \nshook the North Sea. The titanic waves flooded \nthe Dutch coastline, killing almost 2,000 people. 54 years later, a similar storm \nthreatened the region. But this time, the Netherlands \nwere ready. As the water swelled, state-of-the-art computer sensors \nactivated emergency protocols. Over the next 30 minutes, a pair of 240-meter steel arms \nswung shut, protecting the channel ahead. Using 680-tonne ball joints, the barrier moved in rhythm \nwith the shifting wind and waves. By morning, the storm had passed \nwith minimal flooding. The first field activation \nof the Maeslantkering had been a resounding success. As one of the planet’s largest mobile \nstructures, this storm surge barrier \nis a marvel of human engineering. But the Maeslantkering is just one part\nof a massive, interlocking system of water controls \nknown as the Delta Works— the most sophisticated flood prevention \nproject in the world. The Netherlands has a long history \nwith water management. The country lies along the delta \nof three major European rivers, and nearly a quarter of its territory \nis below sea level. This geography makes the region \nextremely prone to flooding. So much so, that some of the earliest \nDutch governing bodies were informal “water boards” that \ncoordinated flood protection projects. But after the storms of 1953, the Dutch\ngovernment took more official measures. They established the Delta Commission, and tasked them with protecting \nthe entire southwestern region. Focusing on densely populated cities, their aim was to reduce the annual odds \nof flooding below 1 in 10,000— about 100 times as safe\nas the average coastal city. Accomplishing this lofty goal required\nvarious infrastructure projects along the southwestern coast. The first line of defense was to dam \nthe region’s flood-prone estuaries. These large inlets fed many of \nthe country’s rivers into the North Sea, and during storms they allowed \nflood water to surge inland. Using a series of dams, the Delta \nCommission transformed these estuaries into expansive lakes that serve \nas nature preserves and community parks. However, this solution wouldn’t work \nfor the Nieuwe Waterweg. As the lifeblood of the local shipping \nindustry, this passage had to be kept open \nin safe conditions, and barricaded during storm surges. In 1998, the completed Maeslantkering provided the flexible \nprotection necessary. Alongside additional barriers, \nlike grassy dikes and concrete seawalls, these fortifications made up the bulk \nof the Delta Works project, which was primarily focused on \nholding back ocean storms. But in the following decades, \nthe Dutch pursued additional plans to complement the Delta Works \nand protect against floods further inland. Under the \"Room for the River\" plan, farms and dikes were relocated \naway from the shore. This left more space for water \nto collect in low-lying floodplains, creating reservoirs and habitats \nfor local wildlife. This strategic retreat not only \ndecreased flood risk, but allowed for the redeveloped \nsettlements to be built more densely and sustainably. Perhaps no city embodies the Netherlands' \nmulti-pronged approach to water management as much as Rotterdam, a thriving city \nalmost entirely below sea level. When a storm threatens, densely populated older districts \nare protected by traditional dikes. Meanwhile, newer districts \nhave been artificially elevated, often sporting green roofs \nthat store rainwater. Numerous structures around the city \ntransform into water storage facilities, including parking garages and plazas which normally serve as theaters \nand sports arenas. Meanwhile in the harbor, floating \npavilions rise with the water level. These are the first of several planned \namphibious structures, some of which house water purification\nsystems and solar collectors. These strategies are just some \nof the technologies and policies that have put the Netherlands \nat the cutting edge of water management. The country continues to find new ways \nto make cities more resilient to natural disasters. And as the rising sea levels \ncaused by climate change threaten low-lying cities \nacross the world, the Netherlands offers an exceptional \nexample of how to go with the flow."
