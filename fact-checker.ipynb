      "The ocean conveyor belt and the Gulfstream. Ocean currents have a direct influence on our lives. They determine our weather, our climate and much more. The ocean currents and wind systems transport heat from the equator to the poles and operate like a large engine for the global climate. In the oceans there are numerous currents. The so-called ocean conveyor belt is very important for our climate. This term describes a combination of currents that result in four of the five global oceans exchanging water with each other. They form a worldwide circulation system. The conveyor belt is also called the thermohaline circulation, with thermo referring to the temperature and haline to the salt content of the water. Both determine the density of the water. While the masses of water may be moved in part by wind, primarily the different densities of the global oceans are responsible for their movement. Warm water has a lower density and rises, while cold water sinks. The water's density also increases with a higher salt content. At the equator the heat from the sun is especially strong, resulting in a lot of evaporation and thus a rise in the water's salt content. That is where the Gulf Stream begins. The Gulf Stream is very important for the European climate. Its length of 10,000 kilometres makes it one of the largest and fastest ocean currents on Earth, and it's very warm. At roughly two metres a second, it brings up to 100 million cubic metres of water per second towards Europe. A constantly blowing wind, the southeast trade wind, drives warm surface water to the northwest into the Gulf of Mexico, where it heats up to 30 degrees Celsius. The turning of the Earth and the west winds then direct the Gulf Stream towards Europe and split it up. One part flows south, another east to the Canary Current, and a third part flows north where it releases a lot of heat into the atmosphere, as the North Atlantic Current. The water becomes colder there. Its salt content and density rise on account of evaporation, and it drops down between Greenland, Norway and Iceland. There we also find the largest waterfall on Earth, the so-called Chimneys, roughly 15 kilometre wide pillars with water falling up to 4,000 metres, 17 million cubic metres of water per second, or roughly 15 times more water than is carried by all the rivers in the world. This creates a strong maelstrom which constantly pulls in new water and is the reason that the Gulf Stream moves towards Europe. Countless species use the Gulf Stream as a means of transport on their trips from the Caribbean to northern areas. But it doesn't just bring us animals. An enormous quantity of warm air also comes with it. In order to reduce the same heat which it brings to the shores of Europe, we would need one million nuclear power plants. That's why we also call the Gulf Stream a heat pump. Without it, the temperature would be significantly colder here, at least 5 to 10 degrees. Instead of lush fields, we would have long winters and sparse ice-covered landscapes in Europe. In the last few years, scientists and pundits in the media have repeatedly expressed the fear that the Gulf Stream could come to a standstill due to climate change. Because if the polar caps actually melt, the salt content in the water off Greenland would fall as would its density. The North Atlantic current would no longer be heavy enough and so it wouldn't sink as usual. In the worst case, that would bring the Gulf Stream, our heat pump, to a stop. Some climate experts also assume that climate change could compensate for this effect. We know that it can be normal for the climate to change by looking at the development of the Earth over the last few million years. There are ice ages and warm periods. In the last ice age, a gigantic flood of melting water crippled the heat-bringing North Atlantic current covering the northern hemisphere in ice. Scientists have different views on the impact that climate change will have on the global ocean conveyor belt. But one thing is clear, when the climate changes, then the complex system of ocean currents and winds which has remained fairly stable since the last ice age will change in ways that we don't yet understand.\n"

      "- Most of the deadliest heat waves to date have been dry heat waves. But as our climate warms\n",
      "a possibly even deadlier heat is on the rise. - It doesn't matter how breezy it is, it doesn't matter how\n",
      "much shade you're under. It doesn't matter how much\n",
      "water you're drinking. - These are extreme humid\n",
      "heat waves, often referred to as wet-bulb events. And these are, in my opinion, one of the scariest byproducts\n",
      "of climate change. They've been relatively rare historically, but a new study shows that\n",
      "by two degrees Celsius of global warming, many of the most populated\n",
      "places on Earth are likely to experience them. And the only way to protect ourselves from\n",
      "these dangerous wet-bulb temperatures is to cool our environment. But what happens if that's not possible? - The time of year that always has the highest\n",
      "stress on the grid is always just the hottest day of the year because so many people are using AC and so then the AC is liable to go out. - What happens if there's\n",
      "another extreme weather event? If you have a tropical cyclone that comes in, wipes out power? - Stick around as we break down why these\n",
      "temperatures are so deadly and how we can prepare for\n",
      "a world that's so warm, our bodies literally can't handle it. Let's start by talking\n",
      "about dry versus humid heat. Dry heat waves are usually driven by large high pressure systems that trap hot air near the surface. These systems push air downward, and as the air compresses, it heats up in a process\n",
      "called adiabatic heating. If the high stays stuck in\n",
      "place, the heat builds day after day with no clouds\n",
      "or wind to carry it away. And that's exactly what happened during the 2003 European heat wave and the 2021 Pacific Northwest heat dome. Now let's take a look at humid heat. - As temperatures rise, we can hold a lot more\n",
      "moisture in the atmosphere. And so this means that if\n",
      "a given location has air temperatures going up with\n",
      "ongoing climate change, it's likely that if they\n",
      "have a moisture source, humidity's also going to increase. - We just saw how dangerous this can be in 2015 when one of the most extreme humid\n",
      "heat events on record struck Karachi, Pakistan. Temperatures up to 45 degrees Celsius combined\n",
      "with oppressive humidity, power outages and water shortages made conditions even worse. At least 1200 people died in just 10 days most from heat stroke and dehydration. Humans primarily cool down by sweating, but when the air is humid,\n",
      "sweat can't evaporate as easily, so we don't cool off as well. This is where wet-bulb comes into play. wet-bulb temperature combines heat and humidity into a single number, which helps us understand\n",
      "when conditions become dangerous or even lethal. - You can imagine taking a\n",
      "normal thermometer. If you take that thermometer and you cover\n",
      "the bulb in a little sock that is then placed into\n",
      "a container of water, so it's constantly wetted. Evaporation's going to take\n",
      "place off of that little sock and it's gonna have a net cooling effect. - The wet sock at the end of the wet-bulb thermometer\n",
      "functions similarly to human skin. Water evaporates off the wet\n",
      "sock while sweat evaporates off our wet skin. In both cases, evaporation carries away heat into the surrounding environment. - But the more humid the ambient\n",
      "air is, the more difficult and less efficient that\n",
      "evaporation is to take place. And so that makes any cooling\n",
      "through evaporative cooling, less efficient at high\n",
      "temperatures and high humidity. - Which is why humid heat feels so muggy and uncomfortable for us and\n",
      "why it can be so dangerous. There have been a number of\n",
      "attempts to better understand how humid heat affects the\n",
      "human body, in particular where our physical limits are, but it's not easy to identify\n",
      "dangerous wet-bulb thresholds because well, they're dangerous. - So obviously you can't put\n",
      "someone in a heat chamber and truly cook them. That would be unethical. But what you can do is increase\n",
      "temperature and humidity and measure someone's core temperature and see what's the point\n",
      "at which their core temperature starts to increase. And that's the limit\n",
      "of compensability. - The human body generally does a good job of regulating its core body\n",
      "temperature through sweat. But once we cross the limit of livability or compensability, as scientists call it, our core body temperature starts\n",
      "to increase uncontrollably. And this wet-bulb temperature\n",
      "range is actually a lot lower than we previously believed. - So this paper is really trying to summarize the most state-of-the-art estimations of these thresholds. And so what we see is\n",
      "that there is a range. So uncompensable wet-bulb temperatures range from about 19 to 32 degrees Celsius. - And you might think the\n",
      "lower end of this range, 19 degrees Celsius sounds really low. But it's important to understand that a 19 degree wet-bulb\n",
      "does not equal 19 degrees on a regular thermometer. So 19 degrees Celsius wet-bulb\n",
      "is actually more like 46 degrees Celsius with low humidity or 32 degrees Celsius\n",
      "with higher humidity. And the reason there's a range is because this threshold depends on a number of variables including activity level, exact air temperature, and\n",
      "humidity levels and age. - Older adults thermo\n",
      "regulatory responses are worse, they sweat less efficiently,\n",
      "they also have higher risks of comorbidities, so\n",
      "things like cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. - So according to their study,\n",
      "where on earth are we likely to cross these thresholds? Well, at two degrees\n",
      "Celsius of global warming, which could come in as\n",
      "little as two decades for older adults. It's about a third of Earth's land area, but that only tells part of the story. - It's 35% of the land area, but it's also many of our\n",
